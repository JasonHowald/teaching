    "text": "Student Learning Objectives\nThe main objective of the course is to learn to write clear, rigorous mathematical proofs. This course partially satisfies the Connecting Clearly: Communication in the Major requirement for the Pathways program. It adopts a “communicating in the disciplines” model that transmits the skills required to both learn and create knowledge within the chosen academic field, and to develop a professional voice through opportunities to write and speak on substantive issues arising from the major. This course will focus on writing.\nAt the conclusion of the course the students will…\n\nIdentify at least two types of written communication specific to their discipline. (Applying)\nExplain what sorts of rhetoric are generally considered effective within the types of discipline specific communication they are studying. (Evaluating)\n\nExplain what sorts of evidence are generally considered valid within the types of discipline specific communication they are studying. (Evaluating)\nProduce (and accept feedback on) substantive written and oral work of their own that applies the understanding they have gained through analysis of models of the types of discipline-specific communication. (Creating)\n\nThese learning outcomes will be assessed throughout the course using homework assignments, in-class tests, and the final exam. Specifically, SLO #1 will be assessed on most homework assignments; SLO #2 on homework assignments and exam questions; SLO #3 on the final exam; and SLO #4 on various homework assignments.\nIn addition to the above outcomes, this course will provide students with an opportunity to develop proficiency in the following areas:\n\nBecome independent learners, capable of doing and learning advanced mathematics on their own and in conjunction with others.\nKnow and use basic proof methods.\nRecognize a correct mathematical proof.\nWrite correct mathematical proofs.\nUnderstand and appreciate the role of mathematical language, notation in the development of mathematical concepts."

    "title": "Introduction to Ring Theory",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Group theory is the theory of algebraic structures with one operation. The axioms of identity, inverse, and associativity are the minimal assumptions which empower the solution of equations, and describe a huge variety of systems.\nMany important mathematical structures have not one operation but four: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and satisfy various other axioms, such as distribution. There is some variability in these structures. In some (e.g., \\({\\mathbb Z}\\)) we lack closure under division. In others we lack a multiplicative identity. In others (e.g. matrix rings) we lack multiplicative commutativity. Our definition of a ring reflects a minimally useful behavior of addition and multiplication. Division is excluded because we often genuinely lose access to division. Subtraction is excluded because addition and additive inverse accomplish the same thing.\n\n\n\nDefinition: A (unital) ring is a set \\(R\\) together with four structural elements: A chosen element called \\(0_R\\), a chosen element called \\(1_R\\), an operation called addition, written \\(+_R\\), and an operation called multiplication, written \\(\\cdot_R\\) or \\(\\times_R\\) (usually unwritten, expressed as implied product), satisfying the following ring axioms:\n\n(Additive associativity) \\(x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z\\)\n(Additive identity) \\(0+x = x = x+0\\)\n(Additive inverse) \\(\\forall x \\, \\exists y \\, x+y = 0 = y+x\\)\n(Additive commutativity) \\(x+y = y+x\\)\n(Multiplicative associativity) \\(x(yz) = (xy)z\\)\n(Multiplicative identity) \\(1x = x = x1\\)\n(Distribution I) x(y+z) = xy + xz\n(Distribution II) (x+y)z = xz + yz\n\nNotes on the definition:\n\nAxioms with free variables are understood to be universally quantified. For example \\(\\forall x \\,\\forall y \\,\\forall z  \\enspace  x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z\\)\nThe first four axioms tell us that \\((R,0,+)\\) is an abelian group. This means that all of group theory applies to ring theory, and is the main reason for doing group theory first.\nNote that there is no multiplicative inverse axiom, so \\((R,1,\\cdot)\\) is not a group. Even if we want to include such an axiom, we must at least make exception for \\(0_R\\).\nIt is not necessary to include \\(0_R\\) and \\(1_R\\) in the defining structure of a group. One can instead rephrase axioms 2 and 6 to state the existence of an identity, which can later be proven unique and labeled. This has no real effect on the theory. Many authors prefer to minimize the number of structures in the definition. This author prefers, within reason, to minimize the number of not-purely-universal axioms. The effect is not only cosmetic, but influences future definitions of “homomorphism” and “subring.”\nNote that there is no commutativity axiom for multiplication. Many structures satisfy such an axiom, and it’s almost always important.\nAxiom #6 can be omitted, in which case we will not call the ring “unital.” \\(2{\\mathbb Z}\\) is an easy example meeting all other axioms. Such a structure is sometimes called a “rng”.\n\nAdditional Axioms of interest\n\n(Multiplicative Commutativity) xy = yx\n(No zerodivisors) \\((xy=0) \\to (x=0 \\lor y=0)\\)\n(Multiplicative inverse) \\(\\forall x \\enspace (x \\neq 0) \\to (\\exists y \\enspace xy = 1 = yx)\\)\n\nA ring satisfying 1-9 is called a commutative ring (or in some contexts, a “ring”!). A ring satisfying 1-10 is called an integral domain or simply a domain. A ring satisfying 1-11 (but 11 implies 10) is called a field.\nThe reader may expect that besides \\({\\mathbb R}\\), fields are hard to come by. On the contrary, there are many interesting and exotic fields.\n\n\n\nNatural mathematical structures with elements which can be added and multiplied are generally rings.\n\n\\({\\mathbb Z}\\) and \\({\\mathbb R}\\) are the original rings. Of course they satisfy axioms 1-10 so they are both domains. \\({\\mathbb R}\\) is a field but \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) is not.\nWe have already seen that the integers modulo \\(n\\), \\({\\mathbb Z}/(n)\\), form an abelian group under addition. But these integers can be multiplied too, and satisfy axioms 1-9. If \\(n\\) is prime, then \\({\\mathbb Z}/(n)\\) is a field.\nFunction Rings Let \\(X\\) be a set, topological space, geometric object, etc, and consider the set \\(C(X)\\) of all continuous functions \\(f:X \\to {\\mathbb R}\\). Since the sum or product of continuous functions is continuous, \\(C(X)\\) is closed under \\(+\\) and \\(\\cdot\\). Since the functions take values in \\({\\mathbb R}\\), they satisfy axioms 1-9. Generally axioms 10 and 11 fail.\nMore generally, in the previous example, “continuous” can be replaced with “differentiable”, “measurable”, “analytic”, “polynomial”, “rational”, etc. As long as the function category is closed under \\(+\\) and \\(\\cdot\\), we generally get a ring of functions.\nThe polynomial rings \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\), \\({\\mathbb R}[x,y]\\), \\({\\mathbb C}[x,y,z]\\), \\(({\\mathbb Z}_7)[w,x,y,z]\\), etc. consist of polynomial functions in the prescribed variables with coefficients from the prescribed ring. They are added and multiplied not as functions but abstractly by manipulating coefficients. So for example in \\(({\\mathbb Z}_7)[x]\\), the elements \\(x\\) and \\(x^7\\) are considered different, even though they act identically as functions on \\({\\mathbb Z}_7\\)\nFor any given size \\(n\\), the set of all \\(n \\times n\\) matrices with real entries, written \\(M_n({\\mathbb R})\\) is a noncommutative ring. The coefficient field \\({\\mathbb R}\\) can be replaced with any field and linear algebra works more or less the same way. It can be replaced with any ring and \\(M_n({\\mathbb R})\\) remains a ring. This ring has many interesting subrings known variously as “matrix rings.” Most are noncommutative.\n\n\n\n\nTheorem Let \\(R\\) be a ring.\n\nThe additive identity is unique\nThe multiplicative identity is unique\nThe additive inverse is unique.\n\\(-(a+b) = -a + -b\\)\nAdditive cancellation\n\\(\\forall x \\enspace 0x=0\\)\n\\(\\forall x \\enspace (-1)x = -x\\)\n\\((-a)*b = -(ab)\\).\n\\((-a)(-b) = ab\\).\nMultidistribution: \\(\\displaystyle a \\sum_{i} x_i = \\sum_{i} a x_i\\)\nTwo-sided multiplicative inverse is unique if it exists.\nMultiplicative cancellation is valid in a domain.\n\nClassroom group exercise: Construct proofs of all twelve.\nBinomial Theorem: \\[(x+y)^n = \\sum_{i=0}^n \\binom{n}{i} x^iy^{n-i}\\]\nproof: The usual proof,\n\n\n\nDefinition: A ring homomorphism is a function \\(f:R \\to S\\) from one ring to another satisfying:\n\n\\(f(0_R) = 0_S\\)\n\\(f(1_R) = 1_S\\)\n\\(f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)\\)\n\\(f(xy) = f(x)f(y)\\)\n\nNote: The first requirement \\(f(0)=0\\) is implied by the third. In general, homomorphisms must preserve whatever structure is imposed. Since we blessed \\(0_R\\) as structural, it makes the list here.\nDefinition: The kernel \\(\\ker(f)\\) of a homomorphism is the preimage of zero: \\[\\ker(f) = \\{x \\in \\operatorname{Dom}(f) \\,|\\, f(x) = 0_S\\}\\]\nDefinition: Let \\(R\\) be a ring. A subring of \\(R\\) is a subset of \\(R\\) which is a ring under the same interpretation of \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(+\\), and \\(\\times\\). That is, it must be a ring under the same operations using the same identities.\nCaution: It is not enough to check \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\). For example, the ring \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times {\\mathbb Z}\\) with coordinatewise addition and multiplication has identities \\((0,0)\\) and \\((1,1)\\). The subset \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times \\{0\\}\\) is a ring under coordinatewise \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\) and is isomorphic to \\({\\mathbb Z}\\). Its identities are \\((0,0)\\) and \\((1,0)\\), so \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times \\{0\\}\\) is not a subring of \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times {\\mathbb Z}\\), and the inclusion map is not a homomorphism. Authors for whom rings don’t necessarily include multiplicative identity would likely disagree on both conclusions, because for them \\(1_R\\) is not a component of the ring structure.\n\n\n\nThe composition of two ring homomorphisms is a homomorphism.\nThe image of a homomorphism is a subring of \\(S\\).\n\\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\)\n\\(f(x^{-1}) = f(x)^{-1}\\) provided \\(x\\) has a two-sided inverse \\(x^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. [\\({\\mathbb Z}\\) is the initial ring] Let \\(R\\) be a ring. Then there is exactly one homomorphism \\(f:{\\mathbb Z} \\to R\\).\nproof: Suppose \\(f\\) were a homomorphism from \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) to \\(R\\). Then \\(f\\) must satisfy \\(f(0)=0_R\\) and \\(f(1)=1_R\\). It follows from additivity (for \\(n&gt;1\\)) that \\(f(n) = f(1+1+\\ldots+1) = f(1)+f(1)+ \\ldots + f(1) =  1_R + 1_R + \\ldots + 1_R\\). Finally it follows for the negative integers that \\(f(-n) = - (1_R + 1_R + \\ldots + 1_R)\\). This determines the function \\(f\\) completely. It obviously satisfies axioms 1-3 of a ring homomorphism, and axiom 4 follows from properties 7-10 above. So there is exactly one such homomorphism.\nStep 2. [Notation] Let \\(R\\) be a ring. We write \\(n \\in R\\) to mean the image of \\(n\\) via the unique homomorphism above.\nWe will prove later that the image of \\(f\\) is isomorphic to \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) or a quotient of \\({\\mathbb Z}\\). For any ring \\(R\\), we can be confident to write \\(18 \\in R\\), but we can’t be sure that \\(18\\) is nonzero!"

    "text": "Group theory is the theory of algebraic structures with one operation. The axioms of identity, inverse, and associativity are the minimal assumptions which empower the solution of equations, and describe a huge variety of systems.\nMany important mathematical structures have not one operation but four: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and satisfy various other axioms, such as distribution. There is some variability in these structures. In some (e.g., \\({\\mathbb Z}\\)) we lack closure under division. In others we lack a multiplicative identity. In others (e.g. matrix rings) we lack multiplicative commutativity. Our definition of a ring reflects a minimally useful behavior of addition and multiplication. Division is excluded because we often genuinely lose access to division. Subtraction is excluded because addition and additive inverse accomplish the same thing."

This means that all of group theory applies to ring theory, and is the main reason for doing group theory first.\nNote that there is no multiplicative inverse axiom, so \\((R,1,\\cdot)\\) is not a group. Even if we want to include such an axiom, we must at least make exception for \\(0_R\\).\nIt is not necessary to include \\(0_R\\) and \\(1_R\\) in the defining structure of a group. One can instead rephrase axioms 2 and 6 to state the existence of an identity, which can later be proven unique and labeled. This has no real effect on the theory. Many authors prefer to minimize the number of structures in the definition. This author prefers, within reason, to minimize the number of not-purely-universal axioms. The effect is not only cosmetic, but influences future definitions of “homomorphism” and “subring.”\nNote that there is no commutativity axiom for multiplication. Many structures satisfy such an axiom, and it’s almost always important.\nAxiom #6 can be omitted, in which case we will not call the ring “unital.” \\(2{\\mathbb Z}\\) is an easy example meeting all other axioms.

A ring satisfying 1-10 is called an integral domain or simply a domain. A ring satisfying 1-11 (but 11 implies 10) is called a field.\nThe reader may expect that besides \\({\\mathbb R}\\), fields are hard to come by.

Convolutional multiplication: \\[ (ab)_k = \\sum_{i+j=k} a_ib_j\\]\nNotation: As long as the polynomial ring over \\(R\\) is denoted \\(R[x]\\), the special element \\((0,1,0,0,\\ldots)\\) is denoted \\(x\\).\nNotation: We often regard \\(R[x]\\) as an extension of \\(R\\) via the identification \\(r = (r,0,0,\\ldots)\\). More precisely we have an natural homomorphism \\(f:R \\to R[x]\\) by \\(f(r) = (r,0,0,\\ldots)\\).\nIt’s rather a slog to prove that \\(R[x]\\) satisfies the ring axioms. It’s a good activity for a student.\nTheorem: \\(R[x]\\) is a ring under the given operations.\nOnce this theorem is proved, we usually wish to switch to the “normal” polynomial notation \\(a_nx^n + \\ldots a_1x + a_0\\). This is not an abbreviation but a literalism. The reader may calculate that \\(x^2 = (0,0,1,0, \\ldots)\\), \\(x^3 = (0,0,0,1,0,\\ldots)\\), etc., and that the recombination \\(a_nx^n + \\ldots a_1x + a_0\\) does yield \\((a_0, a_1, \\ldots, a_n,0,0,0,\\ldots)\\).\nVocabulary: Let \\(f\\) be the polynomial \\(a_nx^n + \\ldots a_1x + a_0\\). We mimic the ordinary vocabulary of algebra: 1. The coefficients of \\(f\\) are the value \\(a_i\\). 2. The constant term of \\(f\\) is \\(a_0\\). 3. The leading term of \\(f\\) is \\(a_nx^n\\). 4. The leading coefficient of \\(f\\) is \\(a_n\\). 5. We call \\(f\\) monic if the leading coefficient is \\(1\\). 6. The degree of \\(f\\) is \\(n\\) (assuming \\(a_n \\neq 0\\)) 7. We call \\(f\\) linear if its degree is \\(1\\). 8. We call \\(f\\) quadratic if its degree is \\(2\\). 9. The value of \\(f\\) at \\(r\\) is \\(a_nr^n + \\ldots a_1r + a_0\\)\nCaution: For polynomials \\(f\\) and \\(g\\), we normally expect \\(\\deg(fg) = \\deg(f)+ \\deg(g)\\). Although this is true when \\(R\\) is a domain, it fails when \\(R\\) is not, because the leading terms of \\(f\\) and of \\(g\\) can multiply to zero. Indeed with zerodivisor coefficients it can happen that \\(fg\\) is simply \\(0\\)."

It’s a key algorithm which not only calculates the GCD of two integers \\(x, y\\) but also solves the equation \\(ax + by = GCD\\). It’s based fundamentally on long division with remainder, a process not supported in an arbitrary ring. Here we define an added structure sufficient to support long division.\nDefinition: A Euclidean Function on a ring \\(R\\) is a function \\(f:R-\\{0\\} \\to {\\mathbb N}-\\{0\\}\\) satisfying 1. \\(\\forall a, b\\in R-\\{0\\} \\enspace f(a) \\leq f(ab)\\) 2. \\(\\forall a \\in R \\enspace \\forall b \\in R-\\{0\\} \\enspace \\exists q, r \\in R \\enspace\\) so that \\(a = bq + r\\) and either \\(r = 0\\) or \\(f(r) &lt; f(b)\\).\nThe Euclidean function \\(f\\) is meant to generalize the absolute value function on \\({\\mathbb Z}\\), which is the basis for saying that upon long division of \\(b\\) by \\(a\\), the remainder \\(r\\) is smaller than \\(a\\). Since \\(f\\) takes values in \\({\\mathbb N}\\), any process of reduction like the Euclidean Algorithm is bound to end because \\({\\mathbb N}\\) is well ordered.\nDefinition: A Euclidean Domain is an integral domain for which a Euclidean Function exists.\nExamples: 1.

So for example \\(30 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 3 \\cdot (-5) \\cdot (-2)\\). Our definition of “unique” needs to allow for such silliness.\nDefinition: A Principal Ideal Domain is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal.\nDefinition: A Unique Factorization Domain is a domain in which 1.

(Existence) Let \\(r \\in R\\) be a nonzero nonunit. If \\(r\\) is irreducible, we’re done. If not, we may factor it into two nonzero nonunits, factor those if necessary, and continue. When this process ends we have a factor tree for \\(r\\) and the factorization is implied. The problem is proving that this process ends instead of continuing forever. Consider \\(C({\\mathbb R})\\), in which the function \\(|x|\\) factors into \\(|x|^{1/2}|x|^{1/2}\\), then further into \\(|x|^{1/4}|x|^{1/4}|x|^{1/4}|x|^{1/4}\\), and so on.\nSuppose to the contrary that a factor tree of \\(r \\in R\\) continues to infinity. Following an infinite sequence of factors downward we can create a sequence of factors \\(r=r_0\\), \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), etc, each divisible by the next, but not dividing it. This corresponds to an infinite chain of ideals \\[(r_0) \\subsetneq (r_1)\\subsetneq (r_2) \\subsetneq \\ldots\\]\nThe containments are strict because each factorization does not just factor out a unit. Now the union of this chain is an ideal \\(I \\subseteq R\\). Since \\(R\\) is a PID, \\(I\\) is principal, generated by, say, \\(a\\). Since \\(a\\) is in the union, it’s in one of the ideals, and \\(a\\) is divisible by some \\(r_k\\). But as a generator, \\(a\\) also divides \\(r_k\\), so \\((r_k) = (a)\\). It follows that \\((r_{k+1}) = (r_k)\\), a contradiction.\nThis shows that every element of a PID can be factored into irreducibles.\nLemma: Let \\(R\\) be a PID, and let \\(a\\) be irreducible. Then \\((a)\\) is maximal (and prime).\nProof of Lemma: Suppose \\((a) \\subsetneq I \\subsetneq R\\). Then \\(I\\) is also principal, so \\((a) \\subsetneq (b) \\subsetneq R\\). It follows that \\(b|a\\) but \\(a \\nmid b\\). But then \\(bc=a\\) and neither \\(b\\) nor \\(c\\) is a unit, contradicting the irreducibility of \\(a\\).\nStep 2. (Uniqueness) We wish to show that any two factorizations of an element \\(r \\in R\\) are “the same” except for rearrangement and unit multiplication of factors. For simplicity, suppose there are two truly distinct factorizations of \\(r\\), and let us consider the smallest possible counterexample in \\(R\\): \\[ua_1a_2 \\ldots a_m = r = vb_1b_2\\ldots b_n\\] Here “small” just means that we have minimized \\(\\max(m,n)\\).\nNow \\(a_m\\) is irreducible and \\(vb_1b_2\\ldots b_n \\in (a_m)\\). By the Lemma, \\((a_m)\\) is prime, so one of the factors must be in \\((a_m)\\). It can’t be the unit \\(v\\). Since we are free to rearrange the factors, WLOG \\(b_n \\in (a_m)\\), so \\(b_n = a_m \\cdot x\\). Since \\(b_n\\) is irreducible and \\(a_m\\) is not a unit, \\(x\\) is a unit. It follows that \\(b_n\\) is a unit multiple of \\(a_m\\), as desired. But this is only one factor. It also follows that \\[ua_1a_2 \\ldots a_m = r = vb_1b_2\\ldots b_{n-1} x a_m\\] Now \\(R\\) is a domain, so we may cancel \\[ua_1a_2 \\ldots a_{m-1} = r = (vx)b_1b_2\\ldots b_{n-1}\\] obtaining, impossibly, a smaller nonunique factorization. This concludes the proof.\nExamples: Naturally it follows that \\({\\mathbb Z}\\), \\({\\mathbb Z}[i]\\), \\({\\mathbb Z}[\\frac{\\sqrt{-3}+1}{2}]\\), and \\({\\mathbb R}[x]\\) all have unique factorization into irreducible elements."

    "text": "7.4 UFD[x] is UFD\n\n7.4.1 Discussion\nThis would be a strange place to conclude, because it stands to reason that larger polynomial rings like \\({\\mathbb R}[x,y,z]\\) or ${Z}[x] also have unique factorization. Since they are not principal ideal domains, some other proof method is needed. We intend to prove:\nTheorem: Let \\(R\\) be a UFD. Then \\(R[x]\\) is a UFD.\nThe first interesting case is \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\). In that case, we need to consider a delicate interplay between polynomials of \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\) and those of \\({\\mathbb Q}[x]\\). In the more general case, we must find a tool to compare a domain \\(R\\) to a field containing it. This brings us to the ideal of a fraction field, which is the next section. Please read the next section and return.\nLet \\(R\\) be a UFD, and let \\(K\\) be its fraction field. Our strategy is to compare polynomials factorizations of \\(f \\in R[x]\\) to similar factorizations of \\(f \\in K[x]\\). This is fraught and requires great care, because conversation will center on which polynomials are “units” and which are “irreducible”, but these notions are relative to the ring under discussion. For example, the constant polynomial \\(f(x) = 2\\) is an irreducible nonunit in \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\), because \\(2\\) is prime and has no reciprocal there. But the same polynomial in \\({\\mathbb Q}[x]\\) is a unit, because an inverse \\(1/2\\) exists. The polynomial \\(f(x) = 4x^2+4 = 4(x^2+1)\\) is reducible in \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\) with factorization \\(2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (1+x^2)\\). But in \\({\\mathbb Q}[x]\\) it’s irreducible, because \\(4\\) is merely a unit factor. (As an aside, over \\({\\mathbb C}[x]\\) it’s reducible for a new reason: Although \\(4\\) is a unit, the polynomial is now \\(4(x-i)(i+i)\\).)\nTo navigate these hazards, we must be in the habit of saying “unit in \\(R\\)” or “irreducible in \\(K[x]\\)” or “reducible over \\(R[x]\\)”, etc.\n\n\n7.4.2 Proof of Theorem\nProposition: Let \\(R\\) be a domain. The units of \\(R[x]\\) are exactly the units of \\(R\\).\nProof: Certainly the units of \\(R\\) have the same reciprocals as elements of \\(R[x]\\). Conversely if \\(f(x)\\) is a unit in \\(R[x]\\), then \\(f(x)g(x)=1\\) for some \\(g(x)\\). Since \\(\\deg(fg) = \\deg(f)+\\deg(g)\\) (in a domain!) both \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) must be constants in \\(R\\).\nProposition: Let \\(p\\in R\\) be irreducible. Then the ideal \\((p)  = pR[x] \\subseteq R[x]\\) generated by \\(p\\) in the polynomial ring is prime.\nproof: Let \\(f, g \\in R[x]\\), and suppose \\(p | fg\\). Then every coefficient of \\(fg\\) is divisible by \\(p\\). For contradiction, if neither \\(f\\) nor \\(g\\) is divisible by \\(p\\), then each has a highest-degree term not divisible by \\(p\\). Say \\(f(x) = p*(h.o.t.)+ a_ix^i + (l.o.t.)\\), and \\(g(x) = p*(h.o.t.)+ b_jx^j + (l.o.t.)\\), with \\(p \\nmid a_i\\) and \\(p \\nmid b_j\\). Then the coefficient of \\(x^{i+j}\\) is a sum of terms, all divisible by \\(p\\) except exactly one. It follows that \\(fg\\) will not be divisible by \\(p\\). It follows that \\(pR[x]\\) is a prime ideal.\nProposition: Let \\(R\\) be a UFD and let \\(K\\) be its field of fractions. Let \\(f(x) \\in R[x]\\). If \\(f(x)\\) factors \\(f(x) = G(x)H(x)\\) over \\(K[x]\\) (so \\(G, H \\in K[x]\\)), then \\(f\\) also factors \\(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\\) over \\(R[x]\\) (so \\(g,h \\in R[x]\\)), and \\(g = k_1G\\) and \\(h = k_2H\\) for some \\(k_1, k_2 \\in K\\).\nProof:  In the factorization \\(f(x) = G(x)H(x)\\), both \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) have coefficients which are fractions with denominators from \\(R\\). We multiply both sides of the equation by the product of these denominators to clear them, obtaining \\(bf = g_1(x)h_1(x)\\). Notice that \\(g_1 = rG\\) and \\(h_1 = sH\\) for some \\(r, s\\in R\\). Note \\(b \\in R\\). By presumption \\(bR\\) can be factored into irreducibles \\(b_1\\ldots b_n\\). We wish to “cancel” \\(b_n\\) from both sides (and continue), but it doesn’t seem to appear on the right. Now \\(b_nR[x]\\) is a prime ideal, and the product \\(g_1h_1\\) is in it, so one of \\(g_1\\) or \\(h_1\\) coefficients all divisible by \\(b_n\\). Therefore we may divide it by \\(b_n\\) and still have a polynomial in \\(R[x]\\). Continuing this process, we cancel every factor \\(b_i\\) from either \\(g_1\\) or \\(h_1\\), to obtain finally \\(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\\). Now \\(g_1\\) was originally an \\(R\\)-multiple of \\(G\\), and is likewise an \\(R\\)-multiple of \\(g\\), so \\(g = k_1G\\) for some \\(k_1 \\in K\\), and similarly for \\(h\\).\nNote: The previous theorem is strongly connected to the Rational Roots Theorem, which limits the possible rational roots an integer polynomial might have. If a polynomial \\(f \\in {\\mathbb Z}[x]\\) has a rational root, then it has a factor \\((x-\\frac{a}{b})\\). (Assume lowest terms) By the previous theorem, it must also be factorable \\(f(x) = (bx-a)h(x)\\) where not only \\(bx-a\\) but also \\(h(x)\\) are integer polynomials.\nLemma: Let \\(R\\) be a UFD and \\(K\\) its fraction field. Let \\(f(x)\\) be irreducible of positive degree in \\(R[x]\\). Then \\(f(x)\\) is also irreducible in \\(K[x]\\) and \\((f(x))\\) is prime in \\(R[x]\\).\nproof: Let \\(f(x)\\) is irreducible in \\(R[x]\\), this means in any product \\(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\\) with \\(g, h \\in R[x]\\), one must be a \\(R[x]\\) unit.\nSuppose \\(f(x) = G(x)H(x)\\) for \\(G, H \\in K[x]\\). Then we get an alternate factorization \\(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\\) in \\(R[x]\\), as above (and \\(g=k_1G\\), \\(h=k_2H\\)). Since \\(f\\) is \\(R[x]\\)-irreducible, one of \\(g\\) or \\(h\\) is an \\(R[x]\\) unit, and therefore a \\(K[x]\\)-unit. It follows that the corresponding \\(G\\) or \\(H\\) is also a \\(K[x]\\)-unit. Thus f is irreducible in \\(K[x]\\).\nIt follows immediately that the ideal \\(f(x)K[x]\\) a prime ideal of \\(K[x]\\), since \\(K[x]\\) is an ED (so PID). What about the ideal \\(f(x)R[x]\\)? If \\(g(x)h(x) \\in f(x)R[x]\\), then this is still true in the larger ring \\(K[x]\\), so one of g or h is in the ideal \\(f(x)R[x]\\). WLOG \\(g(x) = f(x)L(x)\\), where \\(L \\in K[x]\\).\nAs before, \\(g(x) = f_2(x)l(x)\\), where \\(f_2 = Uf\\) and Thus \\(g = Uf(x)l(x)\\). Clearing denominators, \\(bg=af(x)l(x)\\). For each prime factor of \\(b\\), \\(f\\) cannot be divisible (because \\(f\\) is irreducible of positive degree), so \\(l\\) is divisible, so we may cancel it, leaving finally \\(g=f(x)(l(x)/b)\\) where \\(l(x)/b \\in Z[x]\\). Thus \\(g \\in f(x)R[x]\\) and finally \\(f(x)R[x]\\) is a prime ideal.\nAnd finally…\nProof that UFD[x] is a UFD\nLet’s first prove existence of irreducible factorization in \\(R[x]\\). Suppose there were a perpetual factorization: \\(f_1(x)\\) is divisible by \\(f_2(x)\\), which is divisible by \\(f_3(x)\\), etc. Since \\(R\\) is a domain, these polynomials’ degrees would be nonincreasing, so the degrees are eventually constant. After this point, the factors removed are all elements of \\(R\\), and effectively create an infinite factorization of each individual coefficient of \\(f_n\\)\nproof:\nNow suppose \\(up_1\\cdots p_m = vq_1\\cdots q_n\\), where \\(u, v\\) are units of \\(R[x]\\) and \\(p_i, q_j\\) are irreducible in \\(R[x]\\). As before suppose that this is the shortest nonunique factorization. Then \\(vq_1\\cdots q_n \\in (p_m)\\), a prime ideal of \\(R[x]\\), so one of \\(v, q_1, \\ldots, q_n\\) is divisible by \\(p_m\\). Not the unit of course, so for some \\(j\\) we have \\(p_m | q_j\\). Since \\(q_j\\) is irreducible, \\(p_m = wq_j\\) for a unit \\(w\\). Then we may write \\(up_1\\cdots p_{m-1}wq_j = vq_1\\cdots q_n\\) and cancel \\(q_j\\): \\(uwp_2\\cdots p_m = vq_1\\cdots \\hat{q_j}\\cdots q_n\\). This is shorter, so unique factorization applies, so the original factorizations are compatible.\nWe have proven that \\(R[x]\\) is a UFD.\nOf course we can induct on the theorem, to conclude, for example that \\({\\mathbb Z}[x,y,z]\\) is a UFD."

    "section": "8.2 Localization",
    "text": "8.2 Localization\n\n8.2.1 Motivation\nThe field of fractions makes denominators out of all the nonzero elements of \\(R\\). Sometimes we wish to make denominators out of only some of the ring elements. Of course we must exclude \\(0\\). Considering that the fraction addition and multiplication rules introduce the denominator \\(bd\\), the set of elements scheduled to become denominators must be closed under multiplication. In fact this is the only reason why \\(R\\) must be a domain, above. Otherwise the product \\(bd\\) could create a \\(0\\) denominator.\nThe more general construction is to set up a collection \\(S\\) of elements \\(s \\in S\\) which we want to invert, and then use them as the denominators.\nDefinition: A Multiplicatively closed set (mcs) in a commutative ring \\(R\\) is a set which includes \\(1\\), excludes \\(0\\), and is closed under multiplication.\nDefinition: Let \\(R\\) be a commutative ring and let \\(S\\) be an mcs. The localization of \\(R\\) by \\(S\\), written \\(S^{-1}R\\), is \\(\\ldots\\) 1. The set of ordered pairs \\((a,b)\\) (thought of as formal fractions \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\)) where \\(a \\in R\\), \\(b \\in S\\), modulo the equivalence relation \\((a,b) \\sim (c,d)\\) iff \\(\\exists s \\enspace s(ad-bc)=0\\), 2. The zero \\((0_R,1_R)\\) 3. The one \\((1_R,1_R)\\) 4. The addition rule \\((a,b)+(c,d) = (ad+bc,bd)\\) 5. The multiplication rule \\((a,b)(c,d) = (ac,bd)\\)\nThe equivalence relation needs some justification. We identify \\((a,b) \\sim (c,d)\\) when the fractions \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\) “should” be treated as equal. Considering that their difference “should be” \\(\\frac{ad-bc}{bd}\\), it makes sense to regard them as equal when \\(ad-bc=0\\). Why worry if \\(s(ad-bc)=0\\)? Aren’t nonzero zero-divisors tolerated anymore? In that case, once \\(s\\) becomes a valid denominator, the difference will also be equal to \\(\\frac{s(ad-bc)}{sbd}\\), which must be zero because its numerator is zero. This is only happens when a zerodivisor in \\(S\\) gets contorted by the process into a unit.\n\n\n8.2.2 Many, many checks\n\n8.2.2.1 “Equivalence”\nWe start with the claim that \\(\\sim\\) is an equivalence relation.\n\nReflexivity: Note \\(1 \\in S\\), and \\(1(ab-ab)=0\\), so \\((a,b) \\sim (a,b)\\)\nSymmetry: If \\((a,b) \\sim (c,d)\\) then for some \\(s\\), \\(s(ad-bc)=0\\). Negating, \\(s(cb-da)=0\\), so \\((c,d) \\sim (a,b)\\).\nTransitivity: Assume \\((a,b) \\sim (c,d) \\sim (e,f)\\). Then we have \\(s, t\\) so that \\(s(ad-bc)=t(cf-de)=0\\). Multiplying the first equation by \\(ft\\) yields \\(adfst = bcfst\\). Multiplying the second by \\(bs\\) yields \\(bcfst = bdest\\). We conclude \\(adfst = bdest\\), so \\(dst(af-be)\\) as desired. (Note \\(d, s, t \\in S\\) and \\(S\\) is mcs.)\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2.2 Well definedness…\nAssume \\((a_1, b_1) \\sim (a_2, b_2)\\) and \\((c_1, d_1) \\sim (c_2, d_2)\\). This means there are \\(s, t \\in S\\) so that\nE1: \\(\\,\\,\\) \\(sa_1b_2 = sa_2b_1\\) and\nE2: \\(\\,\\,\\) \\(tc_1d_2= tc_2d_1\\)\n…of addition:\nLet’s compare \\((a_1d_1+b_1c_1,b_1d_1)\\) to \\((a_2d_2+b_2c_2,b_2d_2)\\). The goal is to prove, for some \\(q \\in S\\): \\[q (a_1d_1 + b_1c_1) b_2d_2 = q (a_2d_2+b_2c_2)b_1d_1\\] If we try \\(q=st\\) we get \\[\\begin{align}\nst (a_1d_1 + b_1c_1) b_2d_2 =&  sta_1d_1b_2d_2 + stb_1c_1b_2d_2 & \\text{(Distribution)}\\\\\n=& sta_2d_1b_1d_2 + stb_1c_1b_2d_2 &\\text{ Using E1}\\\\\n=& sta_2d_1b_1d_2 + stb_1c_2b_2d_1 &\\text{ Using E2}\\\\\n=& st(a_2d_2 + c_2b_2)b_1d_1 &\\text{ Factoring}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\] as desired\n…of multiplication:\nRarely is multiplication easier to treat than addition. Let’s compare \\((a_1c_1,b_1d_1)\\) to \\((a_2c_2,b_2d_2)\\). We must find \\(q\\) so that \\[qa_1c_1b_2d_2 = b_1d_1a_2c_2.\\] Again we try \\(q=st\\): \\[\\begin{align}\nsta_1c_1b_2d_2 &= sta_2c_1b_1d_2 & \\text{ (Using E1)}\\\\\n&= st a_2c_2b_1d_1 & \\text{ (Using E2)} \\\\\n\\end{align}\\] as desired\n\n\n8.2.2.3 Ring Axioms\nWe can now trust in well defined operations on equivalence classes, it’s safe to introduce the notation \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) for the pair \\((a,b)\\). For sanity, we will use this notation to check the ring axioms.\nFirst note that \\(\\frac{a}{d} \\sim \\frac{as}{ds}\\) whenever \\(s \\in S\\).\n\nAdditive Associativity:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\frac{a}{b} + (\\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{e}{f}) \\\\\n=& \\frac{a}{b} + (\\frac{cf+ed}{df}) \\\\\n=& \\frac{adf + b(cf+ed)}{bdf} \\\\\n=& \\frac{adf+bcf+bed}{bdf}\\\\\n=& \\frac{(ad+bc)f+bed}{bdf}\\\\\n=& \\frac{ad+bc}{bd} +\\frac{e}{f}\\\\\n=& (\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d}) +  \\frac{e}{f} \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nAdditive Identity: \\(\\frac{a}{b}+ \\frac{0}{1} = \\frac{a1+b0}{b1} = \\frac{a}{b}\\)\nAdditive Inverse: \\(\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{-a}{b} = \\frac{ab-ab}{b^2} = \\frac{0}{b^2}\\), which is equivalent to \\(\\frac{0}{1}\\) because \\(b^2 \\in S\\).\nAdditive Commutativity: Obvious, but note it depends on multiplicative commutativity in \\(R\\).\nMultiplicative Associativity: Obvious.\nMultiplicative Identity: Obvious.\nDistribution 1 \\[\\begin{align}\n&\\frac{a}{b} (\\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{e}{f}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{a}{b} (\\frac{cf+de}{df}) \\\\\n&= (\\frac{acf+ade}{bdf}) \\\\\n&\\sim (\\frac{abcf+abde}{bbdf}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{ac}{bd} + \\frac{ae}{bf}\\\\\n&= \\frac{a}{b}\\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{a}{b}\\frac{e}{f}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\] as desired.\nMultiplicative Commutativity: Obvious.\nDistribution 2: Follows from 7,9\n\nThis concludes the proof that \\(S^{-1}R\\) is a commutative ring.\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Basic properties of \\(S^{-1}R\\)\nAs always, we have a canonical map to the newly constructed ring:\nDefinition: A canonical localization map is a function \\(f:R \\to S^{-1}R\\) given by \\(f(r) = \\frac{r}{1}\\).\nNote: If \\(S\\) contains no zerodivisors, then \\(f\\) above is injective, and we regard \\(R\\) to be a subring of \\(S\\)\nIf \\(s \\in S\\) then \\(f(s) = \\frac{s}{1}\\) is a unit in \\(S^{-1}R\\) with reciprocal \\(\\frac{1}{s}\\). It’s safe to treat the fraction \\(\\frac{a}{s}\\) as not a “formal fraction” but literally \\(a\\) times the multiplicative inverse of \\(s\\), as long as we remember that the operations occur not in \\(R\\) but in \\(S^{-1}R\\).\nFraction fields: If \\(R\\) is a domain and \\(S = R-\\{0\\}\\), then \\(S\\) is multiplicatively closed. \\(S^{-1}R\\) is a field because every nonzero fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) has reciprocal \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) (because \\(a \\in S\\)). Since \\(S\\) has no zerodivisors, the canonical map \\(f:R \\to S^{-1}R\\) is injective, so we may safely regard \\(R\\) to be a subring of this field. Thus every domain is a subring of its field of fractions.\n\n\n8.2.4 Universal Property\nTheorem: Let \\(R\\) be a commutative ring and \\(S\\) a multiplicatively closed set. Let \\(f:R \\to S^{-1}R\\) be the canonical map. Then for every \\(s \\in S\\), \\(f(s)\\) is a unit. Moreover for any map \\(g:R \\to T\\) with the property that for every \\(s \\in S\\), \\(g(s)\\) is a unit (in \\(T\\)), there is a unique map \\(G:S^{-1}R \\to T\\) so that \\(Gf = g\\)\nproof: The map is \\(G(\\frac{a}{b}) = g(a)g(b)^{-1}\\). Everything else (including well definedness) is left to the reader.\nShorthand: To define a map from \\(S^{-1}R\\), just define it on \\(R\\) and check \\(S\\) elements go to units."

    "text": "8.3 Ideal Correspondence for Localization\nWe’ve seen that the ideals of \\(R\\) and any quotient ring are closely related. In this section we’ll describe how the ideals of \\(R\\) relate to those of \\(S^{-1}R\\). The key concept is that the elements of \\(S\\) are transformed into units, so any ideal, no matter how small, that intersects \\(S\\) changes into the unit ideal.\nTheorem: Ideal Correspondence for Localization Let \\(f:R \\to S^{-1}R\\) be a canonical localization map. Then extension and contraction across \\(f\\) form a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence between the prime ideals of \\(S^{-1}R\\) and the prime ideals of \\(R\\) which are disjoint from \\(S\\).\nProof: 1. Order-preserving: Extension and contraction always preserve order.\n\n\\(J^{ce}= J\\): Let \\(J \\subseteq S^{-1}R\\) be a proper ideal. Then \\(J^c = \\{r \\in R \\,|\\, \\frac{r}{1} \\in J\\}\\) is known to be an ideal and must be disjoint from \\(S\\) because otherwise \\(J\\) would be a unit ideal. As always \\(J^{ce} \\subseteq J\\). For the reverse, if \\(\\frac{r}{s} \\in J\\) then \\(\\frac{r}{1}\\in J\\) by capture, so \\(r \\in J^c\\). It follows that \\(\\frac{r}{1} \\in J^{ce}\\) and finally \\(\\frac{r}{s} \\in J^{ce}\\) again by capture. Note this portion does not depend on primality of \\(J\\).\n\\(I^{ec}=I\\): Let \\(I \\subseteq R\\) be disjoint from \\(S\\). Notice that the set \\(\\{\\frac{i}{s} \\,|\\, i \\in I, s \\in S\\}\\) is an ideal and is a subset of any ideal containing \\(f(I)\\). It follows that \\(I^e = \\{\\frac{i}{s} \\,|\\, i \\in I, s \\in S\\}\\). If \\(r \\in I^{ec}\\) then \\(\\frac{r}{1} \\in I^e\\), so \\(\\frac{r}{1} = \\frac{i}{s}\\). This means \\(t(rs-i)=0\\) for some \\(t\\). Now if \\(I\\) is a prime ideal disjoint from \\(S\\), then since \\(t \\notin I\\), \\(rs-i \\in I\\), so \\(rs \\in I\\). Again by primality \\(s \\notin I\\) so \\(r \\in I\\). This proves \\(I^{ec} \\subseteq I\\). The other direction is guaranteed, so \\(I^{ec} = I\\).\nWe have established the correspondence. It remains to show it preserves primality. Contraction always preserves primality, so consider extension. If \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\frac{c}{d} \\in I^e = \\{\\frac{i}{s} \\,|\\, i \\in I, s \\in S\\}\\) then \\(ac \\in I\\). If \\(I\\) is prime then one of \\(a, c\\) is in \\(I\\), so one of the fractions is in \\(I^e\\). Thus \\(I^e\\) is prime."

All interactions with AI systems are consultations with an external source, just like a book or another person. Copying the work of an AI system and submitting it as ones own, even with some changes, is a form of plagiarism. Calling on AI for solutions to assigned problems is cheating, for the same reason that hiring your Mom to do your homework is cheating.\n\n\nThinking Mathematically:\nThinking Mathematically courses build proficiency with fundamental tools of mathematics, such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, functions, graphs, and statistics. They teach students precise quantitative logical reasoning and applications of mathematical problem-solving skills in abstract and real-world problems. They engage students in oral and written communication of mathematical ideas.\nMath 125 fulfills the Thinking Mathematically requirement of the Pathways Core Curriculum.\n\nThinking Mathematically Student Learning Outcomes:\nAt the conclusion of this course, students…\n\nUse the fundamental tools of mathematics, such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, functions, graphs, and statistics.

Students use arithmetic and algebra to construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing. Students use functions and arithmetic to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc) of datasets. Students use statistics throughout the course.\nSLO #2: Students solve verbal problems distinguishing between correlation and causation on homework and exams. They verify conditions such as near-normality and sample size for hypothesis tests. They answer homework questions on experiment design which require that they attend to the experimental conditions necessary to draw various conclusions.\nSLO #3: Students learn to use basic data analysis techniques to discover patterns in data. The central limit theorem provides a recurring pattern which students use to solve problems involving p-values, including hypothesis testing, on homework and exams.\nSLO #4: Students use the empirical rule to produce confidence intervals for individual data points and later for parameters based on inference. To understand the general formulations of these rules, students must think of datasets generically and abstractly. On most homeworks, students use formulas for statistics, tests, and inferences which are expressed abstractly to perform concrete computations. The notions of statistic and parameter are themselves abstractions of data computations.\nSLO #5: Students discuss Statistics problems and their solutions in collaborative group work. They present solutions to their peers in the classroom. They also submit individual written work in the form of homework, quizzes, and exams.\nSLO’s #1-#5 will be assessed on various homework problems.\n\n\n\nAccommodative Services\nStudents who need accommodations to complete the requirements and expectations of this course because of a disability should contact the Office of Accommodative Services (136 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2590, oas@potsdam.edu) or complete their request by filling out the New Student Accommodation Request Form. Please note that accommodations are generally not provided retroactively so timely contact with the Office of Accommodative Services is important. Students registered with the Office of Accommodative Services (OAS) should use the Accommodate Portal to submit their “Semester Request” (Letter of Accommodation) every semester. This letter informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable.

The hours of operation can be found on their Facebook page or Get Involved. An Initial Intake is required 3 of all visitors. Additionally, if you are living off campus and in need of supplemental food assistance, you may be eligible for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. To determine eligibility and to enroll, you can visit mybenefits.ny.gov or call Maximizing Independent Living Choices (MILC) at 315-764-9442 x405. The campus has a registered dietician to assist you; you can contact them through the Student Health Services student portal on BearPaws. If you have questions on any of these services or need further assistance, reach out to the Bear CARE Program.\n\n\nLand Acknowledgement\nWe acknowledge with respect the Mohawk Nation, the Indigenous people on whose ancestral lands SUNY Potsdam now stands. We are reminded by our presence here that we have the duty to live in harmony with one another and with all of creation. We are deeply grateful to the families and communities who care for this beautiful place. Beginning with colonization and continuing for centuries the Haudenosaunee Peoples have been dispossessed of most of their ancestral lands by the actions of individuals and institutions. We acknowledge our responsibility to understand and respond to those actions and to commit to working together to honor our past and build our future with truth. For more information on Land Acknowledgements, see Land_Acknowledgement at illuminative.org\n\n\nSuccess Statement\nSuccess in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in your courses or campus life as soon as it occurs and before it becomes too overwhelming. In addition, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you including the Counseling Center & the Case Manager, Student Health Services, Accommodative Services, and your academic advisor.\n\n\nStudent Support\nEvery student in this class is a valued individual. If you are struggling with issues outside of the classroom, please know that there are professionals both on and off campus who can assist you. If you need immediate assistance, please contact our campus Counseling Center (with free counseling) at (315) 267-2330 or visit their website. Links to other resources are provided below: • Title IX Coordinator, Van Housen Extension 392, (315) 267-2516, • Bias Incident Reporting • Center for Diversity, 223 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2184 • University Police, Van Housen Extension, (315) 267-2222 (number for non-emergencies; for an emergency please dial 911) • Student Conduct and Community Standards, 208 Barrington Student Union, • Reachout (24-hour crisis hotline), (315) 265-2422 • Renewal House (for victims of domestic violence), SUNY Potsdam Campus Office: Van Housen Extension 390 (open Wednesdays, 9-5:00), (315) 379-9845 (24-hour crisis hotline), Renewalhouse_campus@Verizon.net • Career Services, Lougheed Learning Commons\nAnd please: if you see something, say something. If you see that someone that you care about is struggling, please encourage them to seek help. If they are unwilling to do so, Care Enough to Call has guidelines on whom to contact. Everyone has the responsibility of creating a college climate of compassion."

All interactions with AI systems are consultations with an external source, just like a book or another person. Copying the work of an AI system and submitting it as ones own, even with some changes, is a form of plagiarism. Calling on AI for solutions to assigned problems is cheating, for the same reason that hiring your Mom to do your homework is cheating.\n\n\nAccommodative Services\nStudents who need accommodations to complete the requirements and expectations of this course because of a disability should contact the Office of Accommodative Services (136 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2590, oas@potsdam.edu) or complete their request by filling out the New Student Accommodation Request Form. Please note that accommodations are generally not provided retroactively so timely contact with the Office of Accommodative Services is important. Students registered with the Office of Accommodative Services (OAS) should use the Accommodate Portal to submit their “Semester Request” (Letter of Accommodation) every semester. This letter informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Further conversation with OAS, faculty, and the student may be warranted to ensure reasonable accommodations.\n\n\nCounseling Services\nAs a student at SUNY Potsdam, you may encounter various stressors that can affect your learning and academic performance. The College Counseling Center (CCC) offers a range of resources to support students in their mental health, social well-being, and overall academic experience. Students seeking to speak with a licensed mental health professional can access free services through the SUNY Potsdam Counseling Center. To connect with our services, please call 315-267-2330, email counseling@potsdam.edu, or visit us at Van Housen 131.\n\n\nDisruptive Student Policy\nIn order to maintain a fair, just, and safe College community environment, students are subject to SUNY Potsdam College regulations and are expected to abide by the Potsdam Pledge, the SUNY Potsdam Academic Catalog, and the Student Community Rights and Responsibilities (the Student Code of Conduct). Anyone who disrupts the academic learning environment (e.g., classrooms, labs, office hours, online platforms, emails, or other virtual communications) will be asked to leave for the day. Disruptions may include, but are not limited to, interrupting/speaking over other people, excessive use of foul or abusive or derogatory language, and repeated getting up/leaving/returning behavior. Students who exhibit aggressive/violent behavior in or out of classrooms will be asked to immediately leave. Disruptive students may be subject to disciplinary action, potentially including administrative removal from the course.\n\n\nFood Insecurity\nThe Prometheus Alumni Food Pantry is in 119 Barrington Student Union. The hours of operation can be found on their Facebook page or Get Involved. An Initial Intake is required 3 of all visitors. Additionally, if you are living off campus and in need of supplemental food assistance, you may be eligible for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. To determine eligibility and to enroll, you can visit mybenefits.ny.gov or call Maximizing Independent Living Choices (MILC) at 315-764-9442 x405. The campus has a registered dietician to assist you; you can contact them through the Student Health Services student portal on BearPaws. If you have questions on any of these services or need further assistance, reach out to the Bear CARE Program.\n\n\nLand Acknowledgement\nWe acknowledge with respect the Mohawk Nation, the Indigenous people on whose ancestral lands SUNY Potsdam now stands. We are reminded by our presence here that we have the duty to live in harmony with one another and with all of creation. We are deeply grateful to the families and communities who care for this beautiful place. Beginning with colonization and continuing for centuries the Haudenosaunee Peoples have been dispossessed of most of their ancestral lands by the actions of individuals and institutions. We acknowledge our responsibility to understand and respond to those actions and to commit to working together to honor our past and build our future with truth. For more information on Land Acknowledgements, see Land_Acknowledgement at illuminative.org\n\n\nSuccess Statement\nSuccess in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in your courses or campus life as soon as it occurs and before it becomes too overwhelming. In addition, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you including the Counseling Center & the Case Manager, Student Health Services, Accommodative Services, and your academic advisor.\n\n\nStudent Support\nEvery student in this class is a valued individual. If you are struggling with issues outside of the classroom, please know that there are professionals both on and off campus who can assist you. If you need immediate assistance, please contact our campus Counseling Center (with free counseling) at (315) 267-2330 or visit their website.
