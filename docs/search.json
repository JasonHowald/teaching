    "text": "3 Student Learning Objectives\nThe main objective of the course is to learn to write clear, rigorous mathematical proofs. This course partially satisfies the Connecting Clearly: Communication in the Major requirement for the Pathways program. It adopts a “communicating in the disciplines” model that transmits the skills required to both learn and create knowledge within the chosen academic field, and to develop a professional voice through opportunities to write and speak on substantive issues arising from the major. This course will focus on writing.\nAt the conclusion of the course the students will…\n\nIdentify at least two types of written communication specific to their discipline. (Applying)\nExplain what sorts of rhetoric are generally considered effective within the types of discipline specific communication they are studying. (Evaluating)\n\nExplain what sorts of evidence are generally considered valid within the types of discipline specific communication they are studying. (Evaluating)\nProduce (and accept feedback on) substantive written and oral work of their own that applies the understanding they have gained through analysis of models of the types of discipline-specific communication. (Creating)\n\nThese learning outcomes will be assessed throughout the course using homework assignments, in-class tests, and the final exam. Specifically, SLO #1 will be assessed on most homework assignments; SLO #2 on homework assignments and exam questions; SLO #3 on the final exam; and SLO #4 on various homework assignments.\nIn addition to the above outcomes, this course will provide students with an opportunity to develop proficiency in the following areas:\n\nBecome independent learners, capable of doing and learning advanced mathematics on their own and in conjunction with others.\nKnow and use basic proof methods.\nRecognize a correct mathematical proof.\nWrite correct mathematical proofs.\nUnderstand and appreciate the role of mathematical language, notation in the development of mathematical concepts."

    "text": "5 Appendices\n\n5.1 AI Policy:\nStudents are encouraged to leverage AI tools, such as Jupyter with code completion features or chatbots for learning help, to enhance their understanding of mathematical concepts and streamline computational tasks. All interactions with AI systems are consultations with an external source, just like a book or another person. Copying the work of an AI system and submitting it as ones own, even with some changes, is a form of plagiarism. Calling on AI for solutions to assigned problems is cheating, for the same reason that hiring your Mom to do your homework is cheating.\n\n\n5.2 Accommodative Services\nStudents who need accommodations to complete the requirements and expectations of this course because of a disability should contact the Office of Accommodative Services (136 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2590, oas@potsdam.edu) or complete their request by filling out the New Student Accommodation Request Form. Please note that accommodations are generally not provided retroactively so timely contact with the Office of Accommodative Services is important. Students registered with the Office of Accommodative Services (OAS) should use the Accommodate Portal to submit their “Semester Request” (Letter of Accommodation) every semester. This letter informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Further conversation with OAS, faculty, and the student may be warranted to ensure reasonable accommodations.\n\n\n5.3 Counseling Services\nAs a student at SUNY Potsdam, you may encounter various stressors that can affect your learning and academic performance. The College Counseling Center (CCC) offers a range of resources to support students in their mental health, social well-being, and overall academic experience. Students seeking to speak with a licensed mental health professional can access free services through the SUNY Potsdam Counseling Center. To connect with our services, please call 315-267-2330, email counseling@potsdam.edu, or visit us at Van Housen 131.\n\n\n5.4 Disruptive Student Policy\nIn order to maintain a fair, just, and safe College community environment, students are subject to SUNY Potsdam College regulations and are expected to abide by the Potsdam Pledge, the SUNY Potsdam Academic Catalog, and the Student Community Rights and Responsibilities (the Student Code of Conduct). Anyone who disrupts the academic learning environment (e.g., classrooms, labs, office hours, online platforms, emails, or other virtual communications) will be asked to leave for the day. Disruptions may include, but are not limited to, interrupting/speaking over other people, excessive use of foul or abusive or derogatory language, and repeated getting up/leaving/returning behavior. Students who exhibit aggressive/violent behavior in or out of classrooms will be asked to immediately leave. Disruptive students may be subject to disciplinary action, potentially including administrative removal from the course.\n\n\n5.5 Food Insecurity\nThe Prometheus Alumni Food Pantry is in 119 Barrington Student Union.

We are reminded by our presence here that we have the duty to live in harmony with one another and with all of creation. We are deeply grateful to the families and communities who care for this beautiful place. Beginning with colonization and continuing for centuries the Haudenosaunee Peoples have been dispossessed of most of their ancestral lands by the actions of individuals and institutions. We acknowledge our responsibility to understand and respond to those actions and to commit to working together to honor our past and build our future with truth. For more information on Land Acknowledgements, see Land_Acknowledgement at illuminative.org\n\n\n5.7 Success Statement\nSuccess in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in your courses or campus life as soon as it occurs and before it becomes too overwhelming. In addition, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you including the Counseling Center & the Case Manager, Student Health Services, Accommodative Services, and your academic advisor.\n\n\n5.8 Student Support\nEvery student in this class is a valued individual.

In other words, what does it take to prove “$P $ and \\(Q\\)”, and how could it used as a premise in a proof?\nAnd-introduction To justify “\\(P\\) and \\(Q\\),” simply justify \\(P\\), then justify \\(Q\\). Once both are justified, “\\(P\\) and \\(Q\\)” may be deduced: \\[\\frac{P , Q}{\\therefore P \\land Q}\\]\nAnd-elimination In reverse, if “\\(P \\land Q\\)” is known, one may conclude the parts separately. \\[\\frac{P \\land Q}{\\therefore P} \\hspace{1in} \\frac{P \\land Q}{\\therefore Q}\\]\n\n\n2.3.3 Notes\nNote for the philosophers:\nNotice that an informal “and” is used in the descriptions of the interpretation of the symbol “\\(\\land\\)”. Foundational logic cannot build logical meaning from nothing. There is always a pre-theoretical, more intuitive logic operating before the theory can develop. Logical foundational work always appears circular or observational rather than cleanly creative. You can waste a lot of effort trying to see around this limitation. [I speak from experience. -jah]\nNote for perceptive and intuitive people\nNormally, asserting “A and B” together also connotes a relatedness of ideas. This is why “It’s snowing and I’m cold” sounds better than “It’s snowing and I’m hungry.” Strictly logically speaking, no relationship between \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) is required or implied, only that both \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are true."

This is the result of our classroom discussion. It is the standard interpretation of \\(P \\to Q\\).\n\n\n\n\\(P\\)\n\\(Q\\)\nIf \\(P\\) then \\(Q\\)\n\n\n\n\nT\nT\nT\n\n\nT\nF\nF\n\n\nF\nT\nT\n\n\nF\nF\nT\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.3 In Proof Theory\nSuppose you want to justify the statement “If \\(P\\) then \\(Q\\).” The most natural approach is to assume \\(P\\), then deduce \\(Q\\). This is often called direct proof:\nImplication-introduction (“direct proof”) If, having assumed \\(P\\), you can prove \\(Q\\), you may conclude “if \\(P\\) then \\(Q\\)”: \\[\\frac{\\begin{matrix}[\\text{Assume } P]\\\\ Q\\end{matrix}}{\\therefore P \\to Q}\\]\nNotice how strange such a proof is: \\(P\\) is not known true, and the act of assuming \\(P\\) is not warranted by any premises or evidence. The proof from the assumption of \\(P\\) to the conclusion of \\(Q\\) is provisional, hypothetical, a house of cards. But the conclusion \\(P \\to Q\\) is known factually and absolutely. Sometimes we say that the assumption of \\(P\\) has been “discharged” by this step, placing the proof on a solid footing.\nAn alternative is to argue that if \\(Q\\) is not true, then neither is \\(P\\). This is called proof by contrapositive. It is based on the fact that “\\(P \\to Q\\)” and “\\(\\neg Q \\to \\neg P\\)” are interchangeable.\nImplication-introduction (“proof by contrapositive”) If, having assumed not \\(Q\\), you prove not \\(P\\), you may conclude “if \\(P\\) then \\(Q\\)”: \\[\\frac{\\begin{matrix}[\\text{Assume } \\neg Q]\\\\ \\neg P\\end{matrix}}{\\therefore P \\to Q}\\]\nAs before, most of the argument depends unsteadily on an unproven assumption \\((\\neg Q)\\), but the final step discharges the assumption and results in something valid and certain.\nNext we need to observe how an implication \\(P \\to Q\\) could be used as a premise:\nImplicaton-elimination (“Modus Ponens”) Knowing both \\(P\\) and \\(P \\to Q\\), you may conclude \\(Q\\).\n\\[\\frac{P, P \\to Q}{\\therefore Q}\\]\nThe ability to conclude \\(Q\\), given \\(P\\), is the essential meaning of “\\(P \\to Q\\)” after all!\nImplicaton-elimination (“Modus Tollens”) Knowing \\(P \\to Q\\), if \\(Q\\) is false, then \\(P\\) must be false.\n\\[\\frac{\\neg Q, P \\to Q}{\\therefore \\neg P}\\]\nAgain this is based on swapping “If \\(P\\) then \\(Q\\)” with “If not \\(Q\\) then not \\(P\\)”, which is the same.\nExample\nWe will prove that if a number is divisible by \\(4\\), then it is even.\nproof: Let \\(x\\) be a number. Assume that \\(x\\) is divisible by \\(4\\). Then \\(x=4n\\) for some other integer \\(n\\). Then \\(x = 2*(2n)\\). Since \\(x\\) is the double of an integer (namely \\(2n\\)), \\(x\\) is even.\nDiscussion: - The line “Let \\(x\\) be a number” is a way of making a argument about all numbers by using a generic singular number \\(x\\). This is sometimes called an “arbitrary particular.” In natural English, this is often accomplished with the pronoun “one” representing an arbitrary particular person: “One should mind one’s manners”. This step introduces a brief context in which “\\(x\\)” represents one fixed but unspecified thing. Any statements about \\(x\\) occurring in this context refer to the same \\(x\\).\n\nThe assumption is made in the second sentence. Often it could be combined with the first: “Let \\(x\\) be a number divisible by \\(4\\).” Technically, the introduction of \\(x\\) and the assumption about it are two distinct logical acts.\nWe know a lot we didn’t say about even numbers, but we used only the most basic, direct interpretation of being even – being equal to twice some integer. This prevents confusion and streamlines the proof. Because every step in a logical proof is asserted with 100% certainty, we don’t need redundant reasoning. We want it simple and clean.\nThe conclusion (\\(Q\\)) is the last sentence. It does not appear out of nowhere but is deduced via sound argument.\nThe implication-introduction needed is left unsaid, merely implied by the argument. This is extremely common. Among regular humans, nobody says “Now we do implication introduction…” or “by the principle of direct proof…” or anything like that. That only happens within formal proof systems.\nThis argument also has an implied universality and a hidden universal introduction. We’ll get to that later.\n\nExample\nProve that if \\(x^4 = 3x-1\\), then \\(x\\) is positive.\n(This equation does have roots but they’re hard to find.)\nproof: Suppose \\(x\\) is not positive. If it’s \\(0\\), then \\(x^4 = 0\\) but \\(3x-1 = -1\\), so they are not equal. If \\(x\\) is negative, then \\(x^4\\) is positive but \\(3x-1\\) is negative, so they are not equal. Either way, they are not equal.\nDiscussion:\n\nHere \\(x\\) is introduced (fixing its value and creating its context) and subjected to an assumption (not positive) in the first line.\nThis also illustrates a proof by cases, which we’ll get to formally soon enough. If \\(x\\) is not positive there are two alternatives.\nAgain the implication-introduction is implied but not said. The structure of the proof (contrapositive) is not obvious and needs to be noticed by the reader. It can be signaled “we prove by contrapositive” but this is not common in serious work.\nThis is a proof by contrapositive, not by contradiction. They are easily confused but distinct structures.\n\nExample\nAn example which illustrates algebraic computation as a series of logical deductions, so that we can think about algebra as forward deduction. Should involve squaring or square roots.\n\n\n2.4.4 Notes\nNote for perceptive and intuitive people\nWhen we assert \\(P \\to Q\\), the implication that \\(P\\) causes \\(Q\\) or is at least related is so strong it’s hard to overcome, but it is not required or implied. We can sometimes affirm \\(P \\to Q\\) even when \\(P\\) and \\(Q\\) are unrelated, for example if we unequivocally know \\(Q\\).

The subtext “…or both” is always entailed. This interpretation is “inclusive or”. The alternative is “exclusive or”, usually written xor or \\(\\oplus\\). Since “or” is inclusive by default, we never say “and/or” in mathematics, because the “and” is superfluous.\nNatural English uses “or” in several senses: Inclusively (“Milk or sugar?”), exclusively (“Your money or your life!”, and to request a choice (“Coffee or tea?”). It’s a constant source of ambiguity and confusion. Natural language is messy, English especially so.\n\n\n2.5.2 In Proof Theory\nOr-introduction\nProving \\(P \\lor Q\\), is sometimes the silly act of weakening a statement by adding an irrelevant alternative:\n\\[\\frac{P}{\\therefore P \\lor Q} \\hspace{1in} \\frac{Q}{\\therefore P \\lor Q} \\]\nFor example: “I know x = 5. Therefore \\(x=\\pm 5\\) This argument form is rare because it’s rarely useful!\nMore substantially, interpreting \\(P \\lor Q\\) as \\(\\neg P \\to Q\\) or \\(\\neg Q \\to P\\) yields a more interesting proof of \\(P \\lor Q\\):\n\\[\\frac{\\begin{matrix}[\\text{Assume } \\neg P]\\\\ Q\\end{matrix}}{\\therefore P \\lor Q} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\n\\frac{\\begin{matrix}[\\text{Assume } \\neg Q]\\\\ P\\end{matrix}}{\\therefore P \\lor Q}\\]\nNotice that either of these argument forms is enough to support the conclusion of “\\(P\\) or \\(Q\\)”. There is no need to do both.\nOr-elimination (Proof by cases)\nKnowing “\\(P\\) or \\(Q\\)” is awkward, because we don’t know which is true. But if both cases lead to the same conclusion, we needn’t care:\n\\[\\frac{P \\lor Q\\,\\,\n\\begin{matrix} [\\text{Assume } P] \\\\ R \\end{matrix}\\,\\,\n\\begin{matrix} [\\text{Assume } Q] \\\\ R \\end{matrix}\n}\n{\\therefore R}\\]\nThis is called “proof by cases.”\n\n\n2.5.3 Exercises – Identify the argument form\nWhat argument form is used in each case? Is the argument logically correct?\n\n“If what you say is true, I can’t forgive you. If it’s a lie, you’re a liar and I can’t trust you. Either way, we’re through!”\n“Well, technically, I said I would have water or tea with dinner. And I had water. So that was true.”\n“Cats make me allergic, but Fluffy here has no effect on me! I conclude that your beloved pet is not, after all, a cat!”\nBy not providing a guest bathroom towel, I have left you high and dry, so to speak. Therefore you are dry and don’t need a towel. You’re welcome.\nLet \\(x\\) be a positive number. Then \\(x&gt;0\\). Multiplying both sides of this inequality by \\(x\\) does not change the direction of the inequality, because \\(x\\) is positive. So \\(x^2 &gt; 0\\). We conclude: If \\(x\\) is positive, then so is \\(x^2\\)."

How do we prove that \\(P\\) is false? Typically by showing that if \\(P\\) were true it would lead to logical disaster, usually represented as a proved falsehood (“\\(\\bot\\)”). The technique is called proof by contradiction\n\nSuppose \\(x\\) were both positive and negative. Then \\(x &gt; 0\\) and \\(x &lt; 0\\). By transitivity \\(0 &lt; x &lt; 0\\), so \\(0 &lt; 0\\), and therefore \\(0\\) is not equal to itself. This is absurd so \\(x\\) cannot be both positive and negative.\n\nFormally: \\[\\frac{\n  \\begin{matrix}\n  [\\text{Assume } P]\\\\\n  \\bot\n  \\end{matrix}\n  }{\\neg P}\n  \\,\\,\\text{ and similarly } \\,\\,\n  \\frac{\n  \\begin{matrix}\n  [\\text{Assume } \\neg P]\\\\\n  \\bot\n  \\end{matrix}\n  }{P}\n  \\]\nOn the other hand, how do we use \\(\\neg P\\) as a premise? Sometimes we have an implication of the form \\(R \\to P\\), so Modus Tolens is one way to proceed. Sometimes we also have a proof of \\(P\\), so we proceed to a contradiction:\n\\[\\frac{P, \\neg P}{\\bot}\\]\nIt may seem silly to imagine that both \\(P\\) and \\(\\neg P\\) can be proven. But inside the context of another assumption (for contradiction, usually), it’s quite common.\n\n\n2.6.3 Examples\nProposition: The square root of \\(2\\) is irrational.\nproof: Assume \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is rational. Then \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) can be written as a fraction \\(\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}\\), in lowest terms, where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are both positive integers. It follows that \\(2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}\\), so \\(2b^2 = a^2\\). It follows that \\(a^2\\) is even, so \\(a\\) is even, so \\(a^2\\) is divisible by \\(4\\), so \\(b^2\\) is even, so \\(b\\) is even, so \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) is not in lowest terms after all. This is a contradiction. We conclude \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) is irrational.\nNotes: - The contradiction \\(\\bot\\) arises from something being proved true and false. What statement was proved true and false? - The contradiction is used for a basic not-introduction. What core steps in the proof set up and complete the not-introduction? - Much is claimed about evenness. Why is each assertion true?\nA paradox is a proof which leads to a contradiction, but lacks any obvious suspicious assumption (for contradiction) which can be blamed for the problem. Nevertheless, the right response to a paradox is to identify an implicit premise which can be questioned. For example, consider the set of all sets which do not contain themselves as elements. Does it contain itself? This is Russell’s paradox. Arguably, it’s a central logical problem with mathematical foundations. The Liar Paradox (“I am lying”) is simpler but equally dangerous.\n\n\n2.6.4 Do not believe a contradiction\nIn real life you may be asked to believe two things which are utterly incompatible. If you submit to such gaslighting, your critical thinking skills will be forced into deactivation, whereupon you can be manipulated by abusers and authoritarians. Don’t let that happen."

    "text": "2.7 Understanding “For all”\n\n2.7.1 Semantics of \\(\\forall\\)\nUniversal statements make claims about every thing under discussion. Some examples in English and math illustrate the point:\n\nEvery lock has a key.\nEveryone has a soul mate.\nCats are mammals.\nThe equation \\((x-1)(x+1) = x^2-1\\) is true for every \\(x\\).\nA number has to be positive, negative, or zero.\n“…that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”\nAll turtles are reptiles, and all reptiles are scary.\n“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”\n\nUniversal statements interact with other logical combinations to create frequent ambiguity and double-meaning. For example\n\nEveryone is not here yet. (\\(\\forall \\neg\\))\nAll that glitters is not gold. (\\(\\forall \\neg\\))\nEveryone is not perfect. (\\(\\forall \\neg\\))\nThe church group is all men or women (\\(\\forall \\lor\\))\nAlright everyone, when ready, begin. (\\(\\forall \\to\\))\n\nEach statement has a double-meaning based on how the universal \\((\\forall)\\) interacts with the rest of the logic.\nMathematical syntax has solved the problem by adding clarifying rules of phrasing: A universal statement should be phrased as a statement about an generic individual (\\(x\\), or \\(y\\), etc) with \\(\\forall x\\) or “for all x” or “for each x” tacked to the front, as a modifier. If there’s any confusion which part of the statement is being modified, parenthesize the statement itself.\nSo, “cats are mammals” becomes the indeterminant, “if it’s a cat, it’s a mammal”, and then the quantified “for each thing, (if it’s a cat, it’s a mammal)”. To be more mathematial, the statement “The equation \\((x-1)(x+1) = x^2-1\\) is true for any \\(x\\).” becomes simply $x (x-1)(x+1) = x^2-1 $.\n“Everyone is not here yet” probably means “\\(\\neg \\forall x (x\\text{ is here})\\)”, but “everyone is not perfect” probably means “\\(\\forall x \\neg (x \\text{ is perfect})\\)”. The formal logic gives clarity where natural language falters.\n\n\n2.7.2 Proof Theory of \\(\\forall\\)\nTo prove a universal statement \\(\\forall x \\enspace P(x)\\), we consider an arbitrary particular \\(x\\) and demonstrate that that one has the property of interest. Formally:\n\\[\\frac{\\begin{matrix}\n  [\\text{Let } x]\\\\\n  P(x)\n  \\end{matrix}}{\\forall x \\enspace P(x)}\\]\nAlthough “Let \\(x\\)” is (arguably) not an assumption, there is a certain parallel with the structure of direct proof. The first line “Let \\(x\\)” creates a context in which \\(x\\) refers to an individual, without determining which one.\nIn common practice, the first line is phrased “Let \\(x\\) be a real number” or “Let \\(x\\) be a function”, etc., and it’s common to attach further assumptions as needed immediately “Let \\(x\\) be an even positive number.” Some formal systems demand simply “Let \\(x\\)” with no further details, and some omit the line entirely on the theory that \\(x\\) inevitably must represent something. No matter which formal system is used, there are some implicit rules about how you can “let \\(x\\)” and later universalize to say \\(\\forall x \\enspace P(x)\\). The most important one is that the symbol “\\(x\\)” must be free for this context. That is, we can’t be working within a context in which \\(x\\) has been assigned a value or assumptions have already been made about it.\nThe meaning of \\(x\\) is stable throughout the argument, but when the argument ends, the variable \\(x\\) goes “out of scope” (as the computer scientists say), and is once again free to represent anything or nothing. And thank goodness, or we’d quickly run out of letters for letting.\n\n\n2.7.3 Examples – proving a generalization\n\nodd * odd = odd\n\\(A \\cap B \\subseteq B\\)\n\\(\\emptyset \\subseteq A\\)\n\n\n\n2.7.4 Using \\(\\forall\\) as a premise\nIf “\\(\\forall x \\enspace P(x)\\)” is a premise, the standard use is to deduce that something in particular has the given property. All men are mortal, so Socrates, a fortiori, is mortal. Proof-theoretically, this looks like:\n\\[\\frac{\\forall x \\enspace P(x)}{\\enspace P(c)}\\]\nWhat is \\(c\\), you ask? Whatever you need. This logical step is usually called specialization. In practice it is done with no more comment than asserting that a certain thing (\\(c\\)) has a certain property."

This is called “proof by example”, or “constructive existence proof.”\nFor example, does an even prime exist? Yes, because \\(2\\) is an even prime. Notice that one example is enough. There is no need to elaborate with more. Is there a hexagon with all right angles? Yes, because the orange tromino qualifies as a “hexagon”:\n\n\n\nTrominoes R. A. Nonenmacher, CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n\nAgain, one example is enough.\nSometimes the example is less explicit, but in context it’s still proof by single example. Consider the statement \\(\\forall y \\enspace \\exists x \\enspace  y &lt; x\\). To prove it, we allow \\(y\\) to be arbitrary, but we choose \\(x=y+1\\) specifically to show the existence of such \\(x\\). Here \\(x=y+2\\) and \\(x=y+0.4\\) would work just as well, but we only mention \\(x=y+1\\), because one example (for each \\(y\\)) is enough.\nIn summary, whenever we have proven that \\(c\\) is a specific example of a phenomenon, then we may infer that there is one:\n\\[ \\frac{P(c)}{\\exists x \\enspace P(x)}\\]\n\n\n2.8.1.2 Assuming \\(\\exists\\)\nWhen an existential statement is known, how do we use it as a premise? This is more difficult because we might not know a specific example. We just know one exists. Typically, the existential is used to introduce a symbol for something which meets the property. For example.\n\nI know that \\(28\\) is a perfect number, and so I know that there must be a smallest perfect number, (though it might not be 28). Let \\(n\\) be the smallest perfect number.\nLet \\(f(x) = x^5 - x^4 + 6x-3\\). Since \\(f(0) = -3\\) and \\(f(1) = 3\\), the equation \\(f(x)=0\\) must have at least one solution. Let \\(a\\) represent a solution.\nThere must be a tallest person in the world. Let \\(A\\) represent that person.\n\nIn all cases, we don’t really know which thing has been chosen, but we trust that the newly introduced symbol represents something correctly. It’s important that the new symbol is unencumbered by other meaning. We cannot, for example, say “Let `jason howald’ represent the tallest person.” or “Let \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) represent the equation’s solution.”"

For example,\n\n4, 5, and \\(\\pi\\) are numbers.\n\\(4 &lt; 5\\) is a true statement. If it has a value, the value is \\(T\\) or \\(\\top\\).\n${4,5,} $ is a set, but \\(4 \\in \\{4,5,\\pi\\}\\) is a statement.\n\\(0 \\leq x \\leq 4\\) is not a set but a statement. Its truth depends on the value of \\(x\\), which is not known in context.\n\nIt’s important to have set theoretical notations to make explicit which sets we mean. Our primary tool for writing a set with clarity and precision is set builder notation. Instead of writing a comma-separated list, we place an order for the elements we want, by means of the conditions we’re looking for:\n\\[\\left\\{ \\text{ [elements we want] }\\,\\, \\Bigm| \\,\\,\\text{ [fine print and conditions.]} \\right\\}\\]\nNotice that the elements go on the left, whereas the conditions go on the right. This is important and can cause some confusion. The braces and middle vertical bar should be large enough to be easily seen to be a group.\nExamples\n\n\\(\\left\\{ x \\in {\\mathbb R} \\Bigm| 0 \\leq x \\leq 4\\right\\}\\) This would be read aloud “The set of x in the reals such that x is between 0 and 4.” It could also be written more simply using interval notation \\([0,4]\\)\n\\(\\left\\{ x \\in {\\mathbb Z} \\Bigm| |x|\n&lt; 4 \\right\\}\\). This makes a finite list which could also be written \\(\\{-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3\\}\\)\n\\(\\left\\{ p \\in {\\mathbb N} \\Bigm| \\text{ $p$ and $p+2$  are prime} \\right\\}\\). This set includes 3, 5, 11, and 17, but not 2, 4, 7, 9, or 13. At present (February 2025) this set is widely believed to be infinite, but we do not have a proof.\n\nNotice that in every example, the left side has the form ``[variable] \\(\\in\\) [Set]’’. There is a variant in which this can be placed on the right as a condition, allowing more interesting operations upon that variable to appear on the left:\n\n\\[\\left\\{ x \\Bigm| x \\in {\\mathbb R} \\text{ and } 0 \\leq x \\leq 4\\right\\}\\]. This is equivalent to #1, above, and shows how the source of values of \\(x\\) can be placed to the right.\n\\[\\left\\{ x^2  \\Bigm| x \\in {\\mathbb Z} \\text{ and } |x|\n&lt; 20 \\text{ and } x \\text{ is prime} \\right\\}\\] This makes a list of squares of prime numbers less than 20. It could be written \\(\\{4, 9, 25, 49, 121, 169, 289, 361\\}\\). Technically the conditions include both negative and positive (prime) values of \\(x\\), so for example \\(9\\) appears as \\(3^2\\) and as \\((-3)^2\\), but it doesn’t matter because a set holds each element only once.\n\\[\\left\\{ \\sin(x) \\Bigm| x \\in {\\mathbb R}\\right\\}\\] This is another way of asking for the image, or range, of the function \\(\\sin\\). You probably already know that the image is the closed interval \\([-1,1]\\)."

The notation requires that \\(A\\) be a set, but requires nothing of \\(x\\): A set can contain numbers, functions, other sets, or even stranger things.\nWe write \\(A \\subseteq B\\) to assert that \\(A\\) is a subset of \\(B\\). The lower bar reminds us that this includes the possibility \\(A = B\\). Some mathematicians write \\(A \\subset B\\) to assert that \\(A\\) is a subset and not equal, but others prefer the clearer notation \\(A \\subsetneq B\\) when we mean to say they are not equal. Confusingly, some use the notation \\(A \\subset B\\) to include the possibility of equality and therefore never use the symbol ``\\(\\subseteq\\)’’.\nInterpretation/Definition of \\(\\subseteq\\): We often need to translate the statement \\(A \\subseteq B\\) into a statement about elements. Of course it means that the elements of \\(A\\) are also in \\(B\\). There are two slightly different styles in which this can be said:\nBound Quantifier Definition of \\(A \\subseteq B\\): \\[A \\subseteq B \\text{ means: }\\,\\, \\forall x \\in A \\enspace x \\in B\\]\nUnbound Quantifier Definition of \\(A \\subseteq B\\): \\[A \\subseteq B \\text{ means: }\\,\\, \\forall x \\left( x \\in A \\to x \\in B\\right)\\]\nThe policy choice between bound quantification and unbound quantification is usually so philosophical and esoteric that it doesn’t matter, even within formal mathematics. But for a few special purposes in foundational work, it’s far better to use unbound quantification. Since the course is called “Set Theory and Logic”, I feel an obligation to do this “the right way” according to the needs of foundational logic, so we will favor the second interpretation. If you’re curious, feel free to ask about the reasons why unbound quantification is your friend.\nThe empty set is a subset\nLet \\(B\\) be a set. Is \\(\\emptyset \\subseteq B\\) true or false? Since we have an official interpretation of \\(\\subseteq\\), we should use it. The bound-quantifier interpretation leads us to ask “Is every element of \\(\\emptyset\\) an element of \\(B\\)?” This remains rather confusing, since \\(\\emptyset\\) has no elements to discuss. Does this make the statement true, false, or merely “wrong?”\nThe unbound-quantifier interpretation, on the other hand, gives us a clear answer: “Is it true, for all \\(x\\), that If \\(x \\in \\emptyset\\), then \\(x \\in B\\)?” Recalling our interpretation of “if… then…”, we identify that “\\(x \\in \\emptyset\\)” is invariably false, so the implication is true for all \\(x\\). We conclude that \\(\\emptyset \\subseteq B\\) is indeed true for any set \\(B\\).

We’re accustomed to writing a function \\(y = x^2\\) or for example \\(f(x)=3x+5\\) and saying “that’s a function.” But which part is a function? Variables are not functions. A variable is an ambiguous reference to an individual thing, usually a real number. So \\(x\\) is not a function, and neither is \\(y\\), despite the idiom “\\(y\\) is a function of \\(x\\)”. We need to clearly consider the difference between a mathematical form and mathematical value. In analytical philosophy, this is called the use-mention distinction. To illustrate:\nUse: Half of eleven is 5.5\nMention: Half of “eleven” is the letter “e”.\nWe use 3x+5 when we reason about its numerical value. We mention 3x+5 when we comment on its form as a combination of symbols:\n\n\n\nMention = form = syntax\nUse = value = Semantics\n\n\n\n\n“3x+5”\n3x+5\n\n\ntype: text string\ntype: real number\n\n\nhas an x in it\ndepends on x\n\n\nhas four symbols\nhas one value\n\n\nis not “5+3x”\nis 5+3x\n\n\n\nNow “\\(3x+5\\)” is a string of symbols, different from “\\(3x+4+1\\)”, with no numerical value. It is neither a number nor a function. On the other hand, \\(3x+5\\) is a single real number which will be known if the value of \\(x\\) is known. It is also not a function. If for example \\(f(x) = 3x+5\\), even \\(f(x)\\) is not a function. The only function here is \\(f\\), not the letter “f” but what it stands for in this context: A mathematical object which knows its potential inputs, its potential outputs, and its method for attaching outputs to inputs, an object which can be “evaluated” at an input using the notation for example \\(f(10)\\) to produce the associated output \\(35\\).\nIn summary, when we write \\(f(x) = 3x+5\\), the function is not \\(y\\), not \\(3x+5\\), nor even \\(f(x)\\), because these are all notations for an individual output. The function is the mathematical \\(f\\), which holds the potential for evaluation at any input.\nNote: The evaluation syntax is \\(f(x)\\), placing \\(f\\) to the left of its input, in parentheses. The function could have (“should have?”) gone on the right, but folks chose the left. The parentheses in “f(x)” are not just for grouping. They are function-evaluation parentheses. They can (almost) never be omitted even when the input is a single symbol."

Apply the limit definition to calculate \\(f'(x)\\).\nSolution:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nf'(x) &= \\lim_{h \\to 0 }\\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{h \\to 0 }\\frac{(x+h)^2 + 3(x+h) + 4 - (x^2 + 3x + 4)}{h}\\\\\n&= \\text{etc.}\n\\end{align*}\\] Somehow the first step is often very tricky. It just requires that the input be carefully plugged in using the formula.\nAside:\nYou may have studied sequences in Calc II. A sequence \\(\\{a_n\\}\\) is just a function \\(a:{\\mathbb N} \\to {\\mathbb R}\\). It doesn’t “feel” like one because we use the funny subscript notation “\\(a_n\\)” instead of the parenthesis notation \\(a(n)\\).\nTest your understanding:\nWhich is most precise? - The derivative of \\(\\sin\\) is \\(\\cos\\) - The derivative of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(\\cos(x)\\)\nFunctions can be different with the same rule and different domains. Functions can have apparently different rules but be the same. Functions can have same domain and range and be technically different with different ranges. Example: max function, average function, eval at 2 function.\nDomain can be literally any set. Example where the set is a set of sets, of vectors, of functions, etc."

    "text": "4 Appendices\n\n4.1 AI Policy:\nStudents are encouraged to leverage AI tools, such as Jupyter with code completion features or chatbots for learning help, to enhance their understanding of mathematical concepts and streamline computational tasks. All interactions with AI systems are consultations with an external source, just like a book or another person. Copying the work of an AI system and submitting it as ones own, even with some changes, is a form of plagiarism. Calling on AI for solutions to assigned problems is cheating, for the same reason that hiring your Mom to do your homework is cheating.\n\n\n4.2 Accommodative Services\nStudents who need accommodations to complete the requirements and expectations of this course because of a disability should contact the Office of Accommodative Services (136 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2590, oas@potsdam.edu) or complete their request by filling out the New Student Accommodation Request Form. Please note that accommodations are generally not provided retroactively so timely contact with the Office of Accommodative Services is important. Students registered with the Office of Accommodative Services (OAS) should use the Accommodate Portal to submit their “Semester Request” (Letter of Accommodation) every semester. This letter informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Further conversation with OAS, faculty, and the student may be warranted to ensure reasonable accommodations.\n\n\n4.3 Counseling Services\nAs a student at SUNY Potsdam, you may encounter various stressors that can affect your learning and academic performance. The College Counseling Center (CCC) offers a range of resources to support students in their mental health, social well-being, and overall academic experience. Students seeking to speak with a licensed mental health professional can access free services through the SUNY Potsdam Counseling Center. To connect with our services, please call 315-267-2330, email counseling@potsdam.edu, or visit us at Van Housen 131.\n\n\n4.4 Disruptive Student Policy\nIn order to maintain a fair, just, and safe College community environment, students are subject to SUNY Potsdam College regulations and are expected to abide by the Potsdam Pledge, the SUNY Potsdam Academic Catalog, and the Student Community Rights and Responsibilities (the Student Code of Conduct). Anyone who disrupts the academic learning environment (e.g., classrooms, labs, office hours, online platforms, emails, or other virtual communications) will be asked to leave for the day. Disruptions may include, but are not limited to, interrupting/speaking over other people, excessive use of foul or abusive or derogatory language, and repeated getting up/leaving/returning behavior. Students who exhibit aggressive/violent behavior in or out of classrooms will be asked to immediately leave. Disruptive students may be subject to disciplinary action, potentially including administrative removal from the course.\n\n\n4.5 Food Insecurity\nThe Prometheus Alumni Food Pantry is in 119 Barrington Student Union. The hours of operation can be found on their Facebook page or Get Involved. An Initial Intake is required 3 of all visitors. Additionally, if you are living off campus and in need of supplemental food assistance, you may be eligible for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. To determine eligibility and to enroll, you can visit mybenefits.ny.gov or call Maximizing Independent Living Choices (MILC) at 315-764-9442 x405. The campus has a registered dietician to assist you; you can contact them through the Student Health Services student portal on BearPaws. If you have questions on any of these services or need further assistance, reach out to the Bear CARE Program.\n\n\n4.6 Land Acknowledgement\nWe acknowledge with respect the Mohawk Nation, the Indigenous people on whose ancestral lands SUNY Potsdam now stands. We are reminded by our presence here that we have the duty to live in harmony with one another and with all of creation. We are deeply grateful to the families and communities who care for this beautiful place. Beginning with colonization and continuing for centuries the Haudenosaunee Peoples have been dispossessed of most of their ancestral lands by the actions of individuals and institutions. We acknowledge our responsibility to understand and respond to those actions and to commit to working together to honor our past and build our future with truth. For more information on Land Acknowledgements, see Land_Acknowledgement at illuminative.org\n\n\n4.7 Success Statement\nSuccess in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in your courses or campus life as soon as it occurs and before it becomes too overwhelming. In addition, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you including the Counseling Center & the Case Manager, Student Health Services, Accommodative Services, and your academic advisor.\n\n\n4.8 Student Support\nEvery student in this class is a valued individual. If you are struggling with issues outside of the classroom, please know that there are professionals both on and off campus who can assist you. If you need immediate assistance, please contact our campus Counseling Center (with free counseling) at (315) 267-2330 or visit their website. Links to other resources are provided below: • Title IX Coordinator, Van Housen Extension 392, (315) 267-2516, • Bias Incident Reporting • Center for Diversity, 223 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2184 • University Police, Van Housen Extension, (315) 267-2222 (number for non-emergencies; for an emergency please dial 911) • Student Conduct and Community Standards, 208 Barrington Student Union, • Reachout (24-hour crisis hotline), (315) 265-2422 • Renewal House (for victims of domestic violence), SUNY Potsdam Campus Office: Van Housen Extension 390 (open Wednesdays, 9-5:00), (315) 379-9845 (24-hour crisis hotline), Renewalhouse_campus@Verizon.net • Career Services, Lougheed Learning Commons\nAnd please: if you see something, say something. If you see that someone that you care about is struggling, please encourage them to seek help. If they are unwilling to do so, Care Enough to Call has guidelines on whom to contact. Everyone has the responsibility of creating a college climate of compassion."

    "section": "5 Appendices",
    "text": "5 Appendices\n\n5.1 AI Policy:\nStudents are encouraged to leverage AI tools, such as Jupyter with code completion features or chatbots for learning help, to enhance their understanding of mathematical concepts and streamline computational tasks. All interactions with AI systems are consultations with an external source, just like a book or another person. Copying the work of an AI system and submitting it as ones own, even with some changes, is a form of plagiarism. Calling on AI for solutions to assigned problems is cheating, for the same reason that hiring your Mom to do your homework is cheating.\n\n\n5.2 Thinking Mathematically:\nThinking Mathematically courses build proficiency with fundamental tools of mathematics, such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, functions, graphs, and statistics. They teach students precise quantitative logical reasoning and applications of mathematical problem-solving skills in abstract and real-world problems. They engage students in oral and written communication of mathematical ideas.\nMath 125 fulfills the Thinking Mathematically requirement of the Pathways Core Curriculum.\n\n5.2.1 Thinking Mathematically Student Learning Outcomes:\nAt the conclusion of this course, students…\n\nUse the fundamental tools of mathematics, such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, functions, graphs, and statistics. (Applying)\nApply precise, logical quantitative reasoning to mathematical hypotheses and conditions. (Applying)\nIdentify mathematical structure and pattern. (Applying)\nEngage in mathematical abstractions. (Applying)\nCommunicate effectively with oral and written skills appropriate to the discipline. (Understanding)\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Methods of Instruction in relation to SLOs:\nSLO #1: Students use boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, and other visualizations to analyze data sets. Students use arithmetic and algebra to construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing. Students use functions and arithmetic to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc) of datasets. Students use statistics throughout the course.\nSLO #2: Students solve verbal problems distinguishing between correlation and causation on homework and exams. They verify conditions such as near-normality and sample size for hypothesis tests. They answer homework questions on experiment design which require that they attend to the experimental conditions necessary to draw various conclusions.\nSLO #3: Students learn to use basic data analysis techniques to discover patterns in data. The central limit theorem provides a recurring pattern which students use to solve problems involving p-values, including hypothesis testing, on homework and exams.\nSLO #4: Students use the empirical rule to produce confidence intervals for individual data points and later for parameters based on inference. To understand the general formulations of these rules, students must think of datasets generically and abstractly. On most homeworks, students use formulas for statistics, tests, and inferences which are expressed abstractly to perform concrete computations. The notions of statistic and parameter are themselves abstractions of data computations.\nSLO #5: Students discuss Statistics problems and their solutions in collaborative group work. They present solutions to their peers in the classroom. They also submit individual written work in the form of homework, quizzes, and exams.\nSLO’s #1-#5 will be assessed on various homework problems.\n\n\n\n5.3 Accommodative Services\nStudents who need accommodations to complete the requirements and expectations of this course because of a disability should contact the Office of Accommodative Services (136 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2590, oas@potsdam.edu) or complete their request by filling out the New Student Accommodation Request Form. Please note that accommodations are generally not provided retroactively so timely contact with the Office of Accommodative Services is important. Students registered with the Office of Accommodative Services (OAS) should use the Accommodate Portal to submit their “Semester Request” (Letter of Accommodation) every semester. This letter informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Further conversation with OAS, faculty, and the student may be warranted to ensure reasonable accommodations.\n\n\n5.4 Counseling Services\nAs a student at SUNY Potsdam, you may encounter various stressors that can affect your learning and academic performance. The College Counseling Center (CCC) offers a range of resources to support students in their mental health, social well-being, and overall academic experience. Students seeking to speak with a licensed mental health professional can access free services through the SUNY Potsdam Counseling Center. To connect with our services, please call 315-267-2330, email counseling@potsdam.edu, or visit us at Van Housen 131.\n\n\n5.5 Disruptive Student Policy\nIn order to maintain a fair, just, and safe College community environment, students are subject to SUNY Potsdam College regulations and are expected to abide by the Potsdam Pledge, the SUNY Potsdam Academic Catalog, and the Student Community Rights and Responsibilities (the Student Code of Conduct). Anyone who disrupts the academic learning environment (e.g., classrooms, labs, office hours, online platforms, emails, or other virtual communications) will be asked to leave for the day. Disruptions may include, but are not limited to, interrupting/speaking over other people, excessive use of foul or abusive or derogatory language, and repeated getting up/leaving/returning behavior. Students who exhibit aggressive/violent behavior in or out of classrooms will be asked to immediately leave. Disruptive students may be subject to disciplinary action, potentially including administrative removal from the course.\n\n\n5.6 Food Insecurity\nThe Prometheus Alumni Food Pantry is in 119 Barrington Student Union. The hours of operation can be found on their Facebook page or Get Involved. An Initial Intake is required 3 of all visitors. Additionally, if you are living off campus and in need of supplemental food assistance, you may be eligible for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits. To determine eligibility and to enroll, you can visit mybenefits.ny.gov or call Maximizing Independent Living Choices (MILC) at 315-764-9442 x405. The campus has a registered dietician to assist you; you can contact them through the Student Health Services student portal on BearPaws. If you have questions on any of these services or need further assistance, reach out to the Bear CARE Program.\n\n\n5.7 Land Acknowledgement\nWe acknowledge with respect the Mohawk Nation, the Indigenous people on whose ancestral lands SUNY Potsdam now stands. We are reminded by our presence here that we have the duty to live in harmony with one another and with all of creation. We are deeply grateful to the families and communities who care for this beautiful place. Beginning with colonization and continuing for centuries the Haudenosaunee Peoples have been dispossessed of most of their ancestral lands by the actions of individuals and institutions. We acknowledge our responsibility to understand and respond to those actions and to commit to working together to honor our past and build our future with truth. For more information on Land Acknowledgements, see Land_Acknowledgement at illuminative.org\n\n\n5.8 Success Statement\nSuccess in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in your courses or campus life as soon as it occurs and before it becomes too overwhelming. In addition, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you including the Counseling Center & the Case Manager, Student Health Services, Accommodative Services, and your academic advisor.\n\n\n5.9 Student Support\nEvery student in this class is a valued individual.

    "text": "Group theory is the theory of algebraic structures with one operation. The axioms of identity, inverse, and associativity are the minimal assumptions which empower the solution of equations, and describe a huge variety of systems.\nMany important mathematical structures have not one operation but four: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and satisfy various other axioms, such as distribution. There is some variability in these structures. In some (e.g., \\({\\mathbb Z}\\)) we lack closure under division. In others we lack a multiplicative identity. In others (e.g. matrix rings) we lack multiplicative commutativity. Our definition of a ring reflects a minimally useful behavior of addition and multiplication. Division is excluded because we often genuinely lose access to division. Subtraction is excluded because addition and additive inverse accomplish the same thing.\n\n\n\nDefinition: A (unital) ring is a set \\(R\\) together with four structural elements: A chosen element called \\(0_R\\), a chosen element called \\(1_R\\), an operation called addition, written \\(+_R\\), and an operation called multiplication, written \\(\\cdot_R\\) or \\(\\times_R\\) (usually unwritten, expressed as implied product), satisfying the following ring axioms:\n\n(Additive associativity) \\(x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z\\)\n(Additive identity) \\(0+x = x = x+0\\)\n(Additive inverse) \\(\\forall x \\, \\exists y \\, x+y = 0 = y+x\\)\n(Additive commutativity) \\(x+y = y+x\\)\n(Multiplicative associativity) \\(x(yz) = (xy)z\\)\n(Multiplicative identity) \\(1x = x = x1\\)\n(Distribution I) x(y+z) = xy + xz\n(Distribution II) (x+y)z = xz + yz\n\nNotes on the definition:\n\nAxioms with free variables are understood to be universally quantified. For example \\(\\forall x \\,\\forall y \\,\\forall z  \\enspace  x+(y+z) = (x+y)+z\\)\nThe first four axioms tell us that \\((R,0,+)\\) is an abelian group. This means that all of group theory applies to ring theory, and is the main reason for doing group theory first.\nNote that there is no multiplicative inverse axiom, so \\((R,1,\\cdot)\\) is not a group. Even if we want to include such an axiom, we must at least make exception for \\(0_R\\).\nIt is not necessary to include \\(0_R\\) and \\(1_R\\) in the defining structure of a group. One can instead rephrase axioms 2 and 6 to state the existence of an identity, which can later be proven unique and labeled. This has no real effect on the theory. Many authors prefer to minimize the number of structures in the definition. This author prefers, within reason, to minimize the number of not-purely-universal axioms. The effect is not only cosmetic, but influences future definitions of “homomorphism” and “subring.”\nNote that there is no commutativity axiom for multiplication. Many structures satisfy such an axiom, and it’s almost always important.\nAxiom #6 can be omitted, in which case we will not call the ring “unital.” \\(2{\\mathbb Z}\\) is an easy example meeting all other axioms. Such a structure is sometimes called a “rng”.\n\nAdditional Axioms of interest\n\n(Multiplicative Commutativity) xy = yx\n(No zerodivisors) \\((xy=0) \\to (x=0 \\lor y=0)\\)\n(Multiplicative inverse) \\(\\forall x \\enspace (x \\neq 0) \\to (\\exists y \\enspace xy = 1 = yx)\\)\n\nA ring satisfying 1-9 is called a commutative ring (or in some contexts, a “ring”!). A ring satisfying 1-10 is called an integral domain or simply a domain. A ring satisfying 1-11 (but 11 implies 10) is called a field.\nThe reader may expect that besides \\({\\mathbb R}\\), fields are hard to come by. On the contrary, there are many interesting and exotic fields.\n\n\n\nNatural mathematical structures with elements which can be added and multiplied are generally rings.\n\n\\({\\mathbb Z}\\) and \\({\\mathbb R}\\) are the original rings. Of course they satisfy axioms 1-10 so they are both domains. \\({\\mathbb R}\\) is a field but \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) is not.\nWe have already seen that the integers modulo \\(n\\), \\({\\mathbb Z}/(n)\\), form an abelian group under addition. But these integers can be multiplied too, and satisfy axioms 1-9. If \\(n\\) is prime, then \\({\\mathbb Z}/(n)\\) is a field.\nFunction Rings Let \\(X\\) be a set, topological space, geometric object, etc, and consider the set \\(C(X)\\) of all continuous functions \\(f:X \\to {\\mathbb R}\\). Since the sum or product of continuous functions is continuous, \\(C(X)\\) is closed under \\(+\\) and \\(\\cdot\\). Since the functions take values in \\({\\mathbb R}\\), they satisfy axioms 1-9. Generally axioms 10 and 11 fail.\nMore generally, in the previous example, “continuous” can be replaced with “differentiable”, “measurable”, “analytic”, “polynomial”, “rational”, etc. As long as the function category is closed under \\(+\\) and \\(\\cdot\\), we generally get a ring of functions.\nThe polynomial rings \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\), \\({\\mathbb R}[x,y]\\), \\({\\mathbb C}[x,y,z]\\), \\(({\\mathbb Z}_7)[w,x,y,z]\\), etc. consist of polynomial functions in the prescribed variables with coefficients from the prescribed ring. They are added and multiplied not as functions but abstractly by manipulating coefficients. So for example in \\(({\\mathbb Z}_7)[x]\\), the elements \\(x\\) and \\(x^7\\) are considered different, even though they act identically as functions on \\({\\mathbb Z}_7\\)\nFor any given size \\(n\\), the set of all \\(n \\times n\\) matrices with real entries, written \\(M_n({\\mathbb R})\\) is a noncommutative ring. The coefficient field \\({\\mathbb R}\\) can be replaced with any field and linear algebra works more or less the same way. It can be replaced with any ring and \\(M_n({\\mathbb R})\\) remains a ring. This ring has many interesting subrings known variously as “matrix rings.” Most are noncommutative.\n\n\n\n\nTheorem Let \\(R\\) be a ring.\n\nThe additive identity is unique\nThe multiplicative identity is unique\nThe additive inverse is unique.\n\\(-(a+b) = -a + -b\\)\nAdditive cancellation\n\\(\\forall x \\enspace 0x=0\\)\n\\(\\forall x \\enspace (-1)x = -x\\)\n\\((-a)*b = -(ab)\\).\n\\((-a)(-b) = ab\\).\nMultidistribution: \\(\\displaystyle a \\sum_{i} x_i = \\sum_{i} a x_i\\)\nTwo-sided multiplicative inverse is unique if it exists.\nMultiplicative cancellation is valid in a domain.\n\nClassroom group exercise: Construct proofs of all twelve.\nDefinition: The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{i}\\), pronounced “n choose i”, is the number of subsets of \\(\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\) which have cardinality \\(i\\).\nProposition: (properties of the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{n}{i}\\))\n\n\\(\\binom{n}{0} = \\binom{n}{n} = 1\\)\n\\(\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n-1}{k} + \\binom{n-1}{k-1}\\)\n\nproof: \\(\\binom{n}{0}\\) counts only the set \\(\\emptyset\\), and \\(\\binom{n}{0}\\) counts only the entire set \\(\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\). This proves part 1. For part 2, every set \\(S \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\\) either contains \\(n\\) or does not. Those that do not are enumerated by \\(\\binom{n-1}{i}\\), and those that do correspond one-to-one (after removal of \\(n\\)) to the sets counted by \\(\\binom{n-1}{i-1}\\).\nBinomial Theorem: Let \\(R\\) be a commutative ring and let \\(x, y \\in R\\). \\[(x+y)^n = \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k} x^ky^{n-k}\\]\nproof: The usual proof of the binomial theorem, given for real numbers \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), goes through without change in an arbitrary commutative ring. We induct on \\(n\\) and observe the base case \\(n=0\\) is trivial. For induction, suppose the theorem is true for \\(n\\) and consider \\(n+1\\). Then\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {n+1 \\choose k} x^ky^{n+1-k} & =\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \\left( {n \\choose k} + {n \\choose k-1}\\right) x^ky^{n+1-k} & \\text{ proposition, above} \\\\\n& =\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {n \\choose k} x^ky^{n+1-k} +\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} {n \\choose k-1} x^ky^{n+1-k} & \\text{ split the sum} \\\\\n& =\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \\choose k} x^ky^{n+1-k} +\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n+1} {n \\choose k-1} x^ky^{n+1-k} & \\text{ Discard zero terms} \\\\\n& =\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \\choose k} x^ky^{n+1-k} +\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \\choose k} x^{k+1}y^{n+1-(k+1)} & \\text{ Reindex second sum} \\\\\n& =\ny \\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \\choose k} x^ky^{n-k} +\nx \\sum_{k=0}^{n} {n \\choose k} x^{k}y^{n-k} & \\text{ Factor and simplify} \\\\\n& =\ny (x+y)^n +\nx (x+y)^n & \\text{ Induction hypothesis} \\\\\n&= (x+y)^{n+1}& \\text{ Simplify} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nNote that \\(\\binom{n}{i}\\) is an integer but the theorem forces us to interpret it as an element of the ring \\(R\\). When we use an integer this way, we mean \\(1_R + \\ldots + 1_R\\), where the sum has \\(\\binom{n}{i}\\) terms. We’ll clarify the situation further after we discuss ring homomorphisms.\nActually in the theorem above, \\(R\\) need not be a commutative ring. It suffices that the elements \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) individually satisfy \\(xy = yx\\). So for example the binomial theorem applies to matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as long as they commute: \\(AB = BA\\).\n\n\n\nDefinition: A ring homomorphism is a function \\(f:R \\to S\\) from one ring to another satisfying:\n\n\\(f(0_R) = 0_S\\)\n\\(f(1_R) = 1_S\\)\n\\(f(x+y) = f(x)+f(y)\\)\n\\(f(xy) = f(x)f(y)\\)\n\nNote: The first requirement \\(f(0)=0\\) is implied by the third. In general, homomorphisms must preserve whatever structure is imposed. Since we blessed \\(0_R\\) as structural, it makes the list here.\nDefinition: The kernel \\(\\ker(f)\\) of a homomorphism is the preimage of zero: \\[\\ker(f) = \\{x \\in \\operatorname{Dom}(f) \\,|\\, f(x) = 0_S\\}\\]\nDefinition: Let \\(R\\) be a ring. A subring of \\(R\\) is a subset of \\(R\\) which is a ring under the same interpretation of \\(0\\), \\(1\\), \\(+\\), and \\(\\times\\). That is, it must be a ring under the same operations using the same identities.\nCaution: It is not enough to check \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\). For example, the ring \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times {\\mathbb Z}\\) with coordinatewise addition and multiplication has identities \\((0,0)\\) and \\((1,1)\\). The subset \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times \\{0\\}\\) is a ring under coordinatewise \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\) and is isomorphic to \\({\\mathbb Z}\\). Its identities are \\((0,0)\\) and \\((1,0)\\), so \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times \\{0\\}\\) is not a subring of \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times {\\mathbb Z}\\), and the inclusion map is not a homomorphism. Authors for whom rings don’t necessarily include multiplicative identity would likely disagree on both conclusions, because for them \\(1_R\\) is not a component of the ring structure.\n\n\n\nThe composition of two ring homomorphisms is a homomorphism.\nThe image of a homomorphism is a subring of \\(S\\).\n\\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\)\n\\(f(x^{-1}) = f(x)^{-1}\\) provided \\(x\\) has a two-sided inverse \\(x^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. [\\({\\mathbb Z}\\) is the initial ring] Let \\(R\\) be a ring. Then there is exactly one homomorphism \\(f:{\\mathbb Z} \\to R\\).\nproof: Let \\(f\\) be a homomorphism from \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) to \\(R\\). Then \\(f\\) must satisfy \\(f(0)=0_R\\) and \\(f(1)=1_R\\). It follows from additivity (for \\(n&gt;1\\)) that \\(f(n) = f(1+1+\\ldots+1) = f(1)+f(1)+ \\ldots + f(1) =  1_R + 1_R + \\ldots + 1_R\\). Finally it follows for the negative integers that \\(f(-n) = - (1_R + 1_R + \\ldots + 1_R)\\). This determines the function \\(f\\) completely, establishing uniqueness. As for existence, the rule above determines a map which obviously satisfies axioms 1-3 of a ring homomorphism, and axiom 4 follows from properties 7-10 above. So there is exactly one such homomorphism.\nStep 2. [Notation] Let \\(R\\) be a ring. We write \\(n \\in R\\) to mean the image of \\(n\\) via the unique homomorphism above.\nWe will prove later that the image of \\(f\\) is isomorphic to \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) or a quotient of \\({\\mathbb Z}\\). For any ring \\(R\\), we can be confident to write \\(18 \\in R\\), but we can’t be sure that \\(18\\) is nonzero!"

For example, the ring \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times {\\mathbb Z}\\) with coordinatewise addition and multiplication has identities \\((0,0)\\) and \\((1,1)\\). The subset \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times \\{0\\}\\) is a ring under coordinatewise \\(+\\) and \\(\\times\\) and is isomorphic to \\({\\mathbb Z}\\). Its identities are \\((0,0)\\) and \\((1,0)\\), so \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times \\{0\\}\\) is not a subring of \\({\\mathbb Z} \\times {\\mathbb Z}\\), and the inclusion map is not a homomorphism. Authors for whom rings don’t necessarily include multiplicative identity would likely disagree on both conclusions, because for them \\(1_R\\) is not a component of the ring structure.\n\n\n\nThe composition of two ring homomorphisms is a homomorphism.\nThe image of a homomorphism is a subring of \\(S\\).\n\\(f(-x) = -f(x)\\)\n\\(f(x^{-1}) = f(x)^{-1}\\) provided \\(x\\) has a two-sided inverse \\(x^{-1}\\).\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. [\\({\\mathbb Z}\\) is the initial ring] Let \\(R\\) be a ring. Then there is exactly one homomorphism \\(f:{\\mathbb Z} \\to R\\).\nproof: Let \\(f\\) be a homomorphism from \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) to \\(R\\). Then \\(f\\) must satisfy \\(f(0)=0_R\\) and \\(f(1)=1_R\\). It follows from additivity (for \\(n&gt;1\\)) that \\(f(n) = f(1+1+\\ldots+1) = f(1)+f(1)+ \\ldots + f(1) =  1_R + 1_R + \\ldots + 1_R\\). Finally it follows for the negative integers that \\(f(-n) = - (1_R + 1_R + \\ldots + 1_R)\\). This determines the function \\(f\\) completely, establishing uniqueness. As for existence, the rule above determines a map which obviously satisfies axioms 1-3 of a ring homomorphism, and axiom 4 follows from properties 7-10 above. So there is exactly one such homomorphism.\nStep 2. [Notation] Let \\(R\\) be a ring. We write \\(n \\in R\\) to mean the image of \\(n\\) via the unique homomorphism above.\nWe will prove later that the image of \\(f\\) is isomorphic to \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) or a quotient of \\({\\mathbb Z}\\). For any ring \\(R\\), we can be confident to write \\(18 \\in R\\), but we can’t be sure that \\(18\\) is nonzero!"

Then \\(f(xy) = f(x)f(y) = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0\\), so \\(xy \\in \\ker(f)\\).\nThe proof above is correct, but suspicious.

We call \\(I\\) prime if \\(I\\) is not the unit ideal and whenever \\(ab \\in I\\), then \\(a\\) I$ or \\(b \\in I\\).\nThis is sort of a converse of the multiplicative capture property.\n** Examples: ** - The prime ideal of \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) are exactly the ideals \\((p)\\) generated by prime numbers, and the zero ideal. - The field \\({\\mathbb R}\\) has only two ideals, and the small one, \\((0)\\), is prime. - A ring \\(R\\) is a domain if and only if then the zero ideal is prime.\nNext we define maximal ideals. The absolute largest ideal in any ring \\(R\\) is the unit ideal, \\(R\\) itself. By “maximal ideal” we mean not quite that large, but otherwise as large as can be:\nDefinition: Let \\(I \\subseteq R\\) be an ideal. We call \\(I\\) maximal if the only ideal which properly contains it is the unit ideal.\nCaution: This is one of those cases when there can be many “maximal” objects. A ring often has many maximal ideals which of course do not have any subset relationships between one another.\nExamples: - The maximal ideals of \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) are, once again, exactly the ideals \\((p)\\) generated by prime numbers. The zero ideal is not maximal. - In function rings, it’s common to construct the ideal of all functions \\(f\\) which take the value \\(0\\) at a given fixed point \\(x \\in X\\). Often, such an ideal is maximal. Except in some very strange circumstances, this sort of ideal will be maximal."

Depending on the condition, an ideal “maximal among desired ideals” may or may not be maximal, but it will often be useful or interesting.\nImagine we have a complicated ring \\(R\\) and a strange condition \\(P\\) on ideals of \\(R\\). We wish to find an ideal \\(I\\) maximal with the condition. Choose any ideal with property \\(P\\). If it’s maximal, great. If not, choose a strictly larger one. If it’s maximal great. If not, continue. Maybe we continue forever. Even then, we produce a chain. Take the union of the chain. Irritatingly, even this is not necessarily maximal. Choose a larger. And larger. And maybe union again. Maybe use the union step infinitely many times and eventually do some sort of super-union. Does this process end?\nThis scenario is taylor made for Zorn’s Lemma:\nZorn’s Lemma: Let \\(P\\) be a poset, ordered by \\(\\preccurlyeq\\). Assume that for every chain \\(\\mathscr C\\) in \\(P\\), there is upper bound \\(z\\) in the sense that \\(x \\preccurlyeq z\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathscr C\\).

As long as the property of interest on ideals \\(I \\subseteq R\\) is preserved by unions of chains of ideals, Zorn’s Lemma can be applied to the poset of ideals having the property, and it produces an ideal maximal among them. (But again, not necessarily “maximal” in the prior sense.)\nExample Applications:\n\nWe apply Zorn’s Lemma to the poset of all ideals of \\(R\\). This produces a maximal element of the poset, which of course is the unit ideal, \\(R\\) itself. What a waste of a Lemma!\nWe apply Zorn’s Lemma to the poset of all proper ideals of \\(R\\). (That is, excluding the unit ideal.) Any maximal element of this poset is a maximal ideal in the normal sense. This demonstrates that every commutative ring has a maximal ideal.\nWe fix \\(f \\in R\\) (not nilpotent) and apply Zorn’s Lemma to the poset of ideals which contain neither \\(f\\) nor or any power of \\(f\\). Notice this condition is preserved under chain unions. The result is an ideal \\(I\\) which may not be a maximal ideal, but will always be prime."

Since \\(f\\) takes values in \\({\\mathbb N}\\), any process of reduction like the Euclidean Algorithm is bound to end because \\({\\mathbb N}\\) is well ordered.\nDefinition: A Euclidean Domain is an integral domain for which a Euclidean Function exists.\nExamples: 1. Of course \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) itself with \\(f(n) = |n|\\) 2. \\({\\mathbb Z}[i]\\) with \\(f(a+bi) = |a+bi|^2 = a^2+b^2\\) 3. \\({\\mathbb R}[x]\\) with \\(f(p(x)) = \\deg(p(x))+1\\). 4. More generally if \\(K\\) is a field then \\(K[x]\\) is a Euclidean Domain. 4. The Eisenstein Integers \\(Z[\\omega]\\) where \\(\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{-3}+1}{2}\\) (Note \\(\\omega^3=-1\\)) form a triangular lattice in \\({\\mathbb C}\\). The complex square norm is again a Euclidean function. In this case it satisfies \\[|a+bw|^2 = (a+bw)(a+b\\overline{w}) = (a+bw)(a+b\\overline{w}) = a^2 + b^2 + ab\\overline{w}+abw = a^2+b^2 +ab 2\\Re(\\omega) = a^2+b^2-ab \\]\nTo prove unique factorization in \\({\\mathbb Z}\\), we first prove that every ideal is principal, then use that fact to prove uniqueness of factorizations. The sames strategy works for rings. Of course even in \\({\\mathbb Z}\\) factorizations differ cosmetically in their ordering and unit multiplication. So for example \\(30 = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 3 \\cdot (-5) \\cdot (-2)\\). Our definition of “unique” needs to allow for such silliness.\nDefinition: A Principal Ideal Domain is an integral domain in which every ideal is principal.\nDefinition: A Unique Factorization Domain is a domain in which 1. Every element of \\(R\\) is zero, a unit, or a product of one or more irreducible elements. 2. Factorizations are unique in the sense that if \\[ua_1a_2 \\ldots a_m = vb_1b_2\\ldots b_n\\] where \\(u, v\\) are units and \\(a_i, b_j\\) are irreducibles, then \\(m=n\\) and (after possible rearrangement of the order of the product) each \\(a_i\\) is some unit multiple of each \\(b_i\\)."

    "text": "7.3 PID \\(\\to\\) UFD\nTheorem: (PID \\(\\to\\) UFD) Every Principal Ideal Domain is a Unique Factorization Domain.\nProof of Theorem:\nLet \\(R\\) be a PID.\nStep 1. (Existence) Let \\(r \\in R\\) be a nonzero nonunit. If \\(r\\) is irreducible, we’re done. If not, we may factor it into two nonzero nonunits, factor those if necessary, and continue. When this process ends we have a factor tree for \\(r\\) and the factorization is implied. The problem is proving that this process ends instead of continuing forever. Consider \\(C({\\mathbb R})\\), in which the function \\(|x|\\) factors into \\(|x|^{1/2}|x|^{1/2}\\), then further into \\(|x|^{1/4}|x|^{1/4}|x|^{1/4}|x|^{1/4}\\), and so on.\nSuppose to the contrary that a factor tree of \\(r \\in R\\) continues to infinity. Following an infinite sequence of factors downward we can create a sequence of factors \\(r=r_0\\), \\(r_1\\), \\(r_2\\), etc, each divisible by the next, but not dividing it. This corresponds to an infinite chain of ideals \\[(r_0) \\subsetneq (r_1)\\subsetneq (r_2) \\subsetneq \\ldots\\]\nThe containments are strict because each factorization does not just factor out a unit. Now the union of this chain is an ideal \\(I \\subseteq R\\). Since \\(R\\) is a PID, \\(I\\) is principal, generated by, say, \\(a\\). Since \\(a\\) is in the union, it’s in one of the ideals, and \\(a\\) is divisible by some \\(r_k\\). But as a generator, \\(a\\) also divides \\(r_k\\), so \\((r_k) = (a)\\). It follows that \\((r_{k+1}) = (r_k)\\), a contradiction.\nThis shows that every element of a PID can be factored into irreducibles.\nLemma: Let \\(R\\) be a PID, and let \\(a\\) be irreducible. Then \\((a)\\) is maximal (and prime).\nProof of Lemma: Suppose \\((a) \\subsetneq I \\subsetneq R\\). Then \\(I\\) is also principal, so \\((a) \\subsetneq (b) \\subsetneq R\\). It follows that \\(b|a\\) but \\(a \\nmid b\\). But then \\(bc=a\\) and neither \\(b\\) nor \\(c\\) is a unit, contradicting the irreducibility of \\(a\\).\nStep 2. (Uniqueness) We wish to show that any two factorizations of an element \\(r \\in R\\) are “the same” except for rearrangement and unit multiplication of factors. For simplicity, suppose there are two truly distinct factorizations of \\(r\\), and let us consider the smallest possible counterexample in \\(R\\): \\[ua_1a_2 \\ldots a_m = r = vb_1b_2\\ldots b_n\\] Here “small” just means that we have minimized \\(\\max(m,n)\\).\nNow \\(a_m\\) is irreducible and \\(vb_1b_2\\ldots b_n \\in (a_m)\\). By the Lemma, \\((a_m)\\) is prime, so one of the factors must be in \\((a_m)\\). It can’t be the unit \\(v\\). Since we are free to rearrange the factors, WLOG \\(b_n \\in (a_m)\\), so \\(b_n = a_m \\cdot x\\). Since \\(b_n\\) is irreducible and \\(a_m\\) is not a unit, \\(x\\) is a unit. It follows that \\(b_n\\) is a unit multiple of \\(a_m\\), as desired. But this is only one factor. It also follows that \\[ua_1a_2 \\ldots a_m = r = vb_1b_2\\ldots b_{n-1} x a_m\\] Now \\(R\\) is a domain, so we may cancel \\[ua_1a_2 \\ldots a_{m-1} = r = (vx)b_1b_2\\ldots b_{n-1}\\] obtaining, impossibly, a smaller nonunique factorization. This concludes the proof.\nExamples: Naturally it follows that \\({\\mathbb Z}\\), \\({\\mathbb Z}[i]\\), \\({\\mathbb Z}[\\frac{\\sqrt{-3}+1}{2}]\\), and \\({\\mathbb R}[x]\\) all have unique factorization into irreducible elements."

    "text": "7.4 UFD[x] is UFD\n\n7.4.1 Discussion\nThis would be a strange place to conclude, because it stands to reason that larger polynomial rings like \\({\\mathbb R}[x,y,z]\\) or ${Z}[x] also have unique factorization. Since they are not principal ideal domains, some other proof method is needed. We intend to prove:\nTheorem: Let \\(R\\) be a UFD. Then \\(R[x]\\) is a UFD.\nThe first interesting case is \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\). In that case, we need to consider a delicate interplay between polynomials of \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\) and those of \\({\\mathbb Q}[x]\\). In the more general case, we must find a tool to compare a domain \\(R\\) to a field containing it. This brings us to the ideal of a fraction field, which is the next section. Please read the next section and return.\nLet \\(R\\) be a UFD, and let \\(K\\) be its fraction field. Our strategy is to compare polynomials factorizations of \\(f \\in R[x]\\) to similar factorizations of \\(f \\in K[x]\\). This is fraught and requires great care, because conversation will center on which polynomials are “units” and which are “irreducible”, but these notions are relative to the ring under discussion. For example, the constant polynomial \\(f(x) = 2\\) is an irreducible nonunit in \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\), because \\(2\\) is prime and has no reciprocal there. But the same polynomial in \\({\\mathbb Q}[x]\\) is a unit, because an inverse \\(1/2\\) exists. The polynomial \\(f(x) = 4x^2+4 = 4(x^2+1)\\) is reducible in \\({\\mathbb Z}[x]\\) with factorization \\(2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (1+x^2)\\). But in \\({\\mathbb Q}[x]\\) it’s irreducible, because \\(4\\) is merely a unit factor. (As an aside, over \\({\\mathbb C}[x]\\) it’s reducible for a new reason: Although \\(4\\) is a unit, the polynomial is now \\(4(x-i)(i+i)\\).)\nTo navigate these hazards, we must be in the habit of saying “unit in \\(R\\)” or “irreducible in \\(K[x]\\)” or “reducible over \\(R[x]\\)”, etc.\n\n\n7.4.2 Proof of Theorem\nProposition: Let \\(R\\) be a domain. The units of \\(R[x]\\) are exactly the units of \\(R\\).\nProof: Certainly the units of \\(R\\) have the same reciprocals as elements of \\(R[x]\\). Conversely if \\(f(x)\\) is a unit in \\(R[x]\\), then \\(f(x)g(x)=1\\) for some \\(g(x)\\). Since \\(\\deg(fg) = \\deg(f)+\\deg(g)\\) (in a domain!) both \\(f\\) and \\(g\\) must be constants in \\(R\\).\nProposition: Let \\(p\\in R\\) be irreducible. Then the ideal \\((p)  = pR[x] \\subseteq R[x]\\) generated by \\(p\\) in the polynomial ring is prime.\nproof: Let \\(f, g \\in R[x]\\), and suppose \\(p | fg\\). Then every coefficient of \\(fg\\) is divisible by \\(p\\). For contradiction, if neither \\(f\\) nor \\(g\\) is divisible by \\(p\\), then each has a highest-degree term not divisible by \\(p\\). Say \\(f(x) = p*(h.o.t.)+ a_ix^i + (l.o.t.)\\), and \\(g(x) = p*(h.o.t.)+ b_jx^j + (l.o.t.)\\), with \\(p \\nmid a_i\\) and \\(p \\nmid b_j\\). Then the coefficient of \\(x^{i+j}\\) is a sum of terms, all divisible by \\(p\\) except exactly one. It follows that \\(fg\\) will not be divisible by \\(p\\). It follows that \\(pR[x]\\) is a prime ideal.\nProposition: Let \\(R\\) be a UFD and let \\(K\\) be its field of fractions. Let \\(f(x) \\in R[x]\\). If \\(f(x)\\) factors \\(f(x) = G(x)H(x)\\) over \\(K[x]\\) (so \\(G, H \\in K[x]\\)), then \\(f\\) also factors \\(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\\) over \\(R[x]\\) (so \\(g,h \\in R[x]\\)), and \\(g = k_1G\\) and \\(h = k_2H\\) for some \\(k_1, k_2 \\in K\\).\nProof:  In the factorization \\(f(x) = G(x)H(x)\\), both \\(G\\) and \\(H\\) have coefficients which are fractions with denominators from \\(R\\). We multiply both sides of the equation by the product of these denominators to clear them, obtaining \\(bf = g_1(x)h_1(x)\\). Notice that \\(g_1 = rG\\) and \\(h_1 = sH\\) for some \\(r, s\\in R\\). Note \\(b \\in R\\). By presumption \\(bR\\) can be factored into irreducibles \\(b_1\\ldots b_n\\). We wish to “cancel” \\(b_n\\) from both sides (and continue), but it doesn’t seem to appear on the right. Now \\(b_nR[x]\\) is a prime ideal, and the product \\(g_1h_1\\) is in it, so one of \\(g_1\\) or \\(h_1\\) coefficients all divisible by \\(b_n\\). Therefore we may divide it by \\(b_n\\) and still have a polynomial in \\(R[x]\\). Continuing this process, we cancel every factor \\(b_i\\) from either \\(g_1\\) or \\(h_1\\), to obtain finally \\(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\\). Now \\(g_1\\) was originally an \\(R\\)-multiple of \\(G\\), and is likewise an \\(R\\)-multiple of \\(g\\), so \\(g = k_1G\\) for some \\(k_1 \\in K\\), and similarly for \\(h\\).\nNote: The previous theorem is strongly connected to the Rational Roots Theorem, which limits the possible rational roots an integer polynomial might have. If a polynomial \\(f \\in {\\mathbb Z}[x]\\) has a rational root, then it has a factor \\((x-\\frac{a}{b})\\). (Assume lowest terms) By the previous theorem, it must also be factorable \\(f(x) = (bx-a)h(x)\\) where not only \\(bx-a\\) but also \\(h(x)\\) are integer polynomials.\nLemma: Let \\(R\\) be a UFD and \\(K\\) its fraction field. Let \\(f(x)\\) be irreducible of positive degree in \\(R[x]\\). Then \\(f(x)\\) is also irreducible in \\(K[x]\\) and \\((f(x))\\) is prime in \\(R[x]\\).\nproof: Let \\(f(x)\\) is irreducible in \\(R[x]\\), this means in any product \\(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\\) with \\(g, h \\in R[x]\\), one must be a \\(R[x]\\) unit.\nSuppose \\(f(x) = G(x)H(x)\\) for \\(G, H \\in K[x]\\). Then we get an alternate factorization \\(f(x) = g(x)h(x)\\) in \\(R[x]\\), as above (and \\(g=k_1G\\), \\(h=k_2H\\)). Since \\(f\\) is \\(R[x]\\)-irreducible, one of \\(g\\) or \\(h\\) is an \\(R[x]\\) unit, and therefore a \\(K[x]\\)-unit. It follows that the corresponding \\(G\\) or \\(H\\) is also a \\(K[x]\\)-unit. Thus f is irreducible in \\(K[x]\\).\nIt follows immediately that the ideal \\(f(x)K[x]\\) a prime ideal of \\(K[x]\\), since \\(K[x]\\) is an ED (so PID). What about the ideal \\(f(x)R[x]\\)? If \\(g(x)h(x) \\in f(x)R[x]\\), then this is still true in the larger ring \\(K[x]\\), so one of g or h is in the ideal \\(f(x)R[x]\\). WLOG \\(g(x) = f(x)L(x)\\), where \\(L \\in K[x]\\).\nAs before, \\(g(x) = f_2(x)l(x)\\), where \\(f_2 = Uf\\) and Thus \\(g = Uf(x)l(x)\\). Clearing denominators, \\(bg=af(x)l(x)\\). For each prime factor of \\(b\\), \\(f\\) cannot be divisible (because \\(f\\) is irreducible of positive degree), so \\(l\\) is divisible, so we may cancel it, leaving finally \\(g=f(x)(l(x)/b)\\) where \\(l(x)/b \\in Z[x]\\). Thus \\(g \\in f(x)R[x]\\) and finally \\(f(x)R[x]\\) is a prime ideal.\nAnd finally…\nProof that UFD[x] is a UFD\nLet’s first prove existence of irreducible factorization in \\(R[x]\\). Suppose there were a perpetual factorization: \\(f_1(x)\\) is divisible by \\(f_2(x)\\), which is divisible by \\(f_3(x)\\), etc. Since \\(R\\) is a domain, these polynomials’ degrees would be nonincreasing, so the degrees are eventually constant. After this point, the factors removed are all elements of \\(R\\), and effectively create an infinite factorization of each individual coefficient of \\(f_n\\)\nproof:\nNow suppose \\(up_1\\cdots p_m = vq_1\\cdots q_n\\), where \\(u, v\\) are units of \\(R[x]\\) and \\(p_i, q_j\\) are irreducible in \\(R[x]\\). As before suppose that this is the shortest nonunique factorization. Then \\(vq_1\\cdots q_n \\in (p_m)\\), a prime ideal of \\(R[x]\\), so one of \\(v, q_1, \\ldots, q_n\\) is divisible by \\(p_m\\). Not the unit of course, so for some \\(j\\) we have \\(p_m | q_j\\). Since \\(q_j\\) is irreducible, \\(p_m = wq_j\\) for a unit \\(w\\). Then we may write \\(up_1\\cdots p_{m-1}wq_j = vq_1\\cdots q_n\\) and cancel \\(q_j\\): \\(uwp_2\\cdots p_m = vq_1\\cdots \\hat{q_j}\\cdots q_n\\). This is shorter, so unique factorization applies, so the original factorizations are compatible.\nWe have proven that \\(R[x]\\) is a UFD.\nOf course we can induct on the theorem, to conclude, for example that \\({\\mathbb Z}[x,y,z]\\) is a UFD."

    "text": "8.2 Localization\n\n8.2.1 Motivation\nThe field of fractions makes denominators out of all the nonzero elements of \\(R\\). Sometimes we wish to make denominators out of only some of the ring elements. Of course we must exclude \\(0\\). Considering that the fraction addition and multiplication rules introduce the denominator \\(bd\\), the set of elements scheduled to become denominators must be closed under multiplication. In fact this is the only reason why \\(R\\) must be a domain, above. Otherwise the product \\(bd\\) could create a \\(0\\) denominator.\nThe more general construction is to set up a collection \\(S\\) of elements \\(s \\in S\\) which we want to invert, and then use them as the denominators.\nDefinition: A Multiplicatively closed set (mcs) in a commutative ring \\(R\\) is a set which includes \\(1\\), excludes \\(0\\), and is closed under multiplication.\nDefinition: Let \\(R\\) be a commutative ring and let \\(S\\) be an mcs.

We identify \\((a,b) \\sim (c,d)\\) when the fractions \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and \\(\\frac{c}{d}\\) “should” be treated as equal. Considering that their difference “should be” \\(\\frac{ad-bc}{bd}\\), it makes sense to regard them as equal when \\(ad-bc=0\\). Why worry if \\(s(ad-bc)=0\\)? Aren’t nonzero zero-divisors tolerated anymore? In that case, once \\(s\\) becomes a valid denominator, the difference will also be equal to \\(\\frac{s(ad-bc)}{sbd}\\), which must be zero because its numerator is zero. This is only happens when a zerodivisor in \\(S\\) gets contorted by the process into a unit.\n\n\n8.2.2 Many, many checks\n\n8.2.2.1 “Equivalence”\nWe start with the claim that \\(\\sim\\) is an equivalence relation.\n\nReflexivity: Note \\(1 \\in S\\), and \\(1(ab-ab)=0\\), so \\((a,b) \\sim (a,b)\\)\nSymmetry: If \\((a,b) \\sim (c,d)\\) then for some \\(s\\), \\(s(ad-bc)=0\\).

For sanity, we will use this notation to check the ring axioms.\nFirst note that \\(\\frac{a}{d} \\sim \\frac{as}{ds}\\) whenever \\(s \\in S\\).\n\nAdditive Associativity:\n\n\\[\\begin{align}\n&\\frac{a}{b} + (\\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{e}{f}) \\\\\n=& \\frac{a}{b} + (\\frac{cf+ed}{df}) \\\\\n=& \\frac{adf + b(cf+ed)}{bdf} \\\\\n=& \\frac{adf+bcf+bed}{bdf}\\\\\n=& \\frac{(ad+bc)f+bed}{bdf}\\\\\n=& \\frac{ad+bc}{bd} +\\frac{e}{f}\\\\\n=& (\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d}) +  \\frac{e}{f} \\\\\n\\end{align}\\]\n\nAdditive Identity: \\(\\frac{a}{b}+ \\frac{0}{1} = \\frac{a1+b0}{b1} = \\frac{a}{b}\\)\nAdditive Inverse: \\(\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{-a}{b} = \\frac{ab-ab}{b^2} = \\frac{0}{b^2}\\), which is equivalent to \\(\\frac{0}{1}\\) because \\(b^2 \\in S\\).\nAdditive Commutativity: Obvious, but note it depends on multiplicative commutativity in \\(R\\).\nMultiplicative Associativity: Obvious.\nMultiplicative Identity: Obvious.\nDistribution 1 \\[\\begin{align}\n&\\frac{a}{b} (\\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{e}{f}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{a}{b} (\\frac{cf+de}{df}) \\\\\n&= (\\frac{acf+ade}{bdf}) \\\\\n&\\sim (\\frac{abcf+abde}{bbdf}) \\\\\n&= \\frac{ac}{bd} + \\frac{ae}{bf}\\\\\n&= \\frac{a}{b}\\frac{c}{d} + \\frac{a}{b}\\frac{e}{f}\\\\\n\\end{align}\\] as desired.\nMultiplicative Commutativity: Obvious.\nDistribution 2: Follows from 7,9\n\nThis concludes the proof that \\(S^{-1}R\\) is a commutative ring.\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Basic properties of \\(S^{-1}R\\)\nAs always, we have a canonical map to the newly constructed ring:\nDefinition: A canonical localization map is a function \\(f:R \\to S^{-1}R\\) given by \\(f(r) = \\frac{r}{1}\\).\nNote: If \\(S\\) contains no zerodivisors, then \\(f\\) above is injective, and we regard \\(R\\) to be a subring of \\(S\\)\nIf \\(s \\in S\\) then \\(f(s) = \\frac{s}{1}\\) is a unit in \\(S^{-1}R\\) with reciprocal \\(\\frac{1}{s}\\). It’s safe to treat the fraction \\(\\frac{a}{s}\\) as not a “formal fraction” but literally \\(a\\) times the multiplicative inverse of \\(s\\), as long as we remember that the operations occur not in \\(R\\) but in \\(S^{-1}R\\).\nFraction fields: If \\(R\\) is a domain and \\(S = R-\\{0\\}\\), then \\(S\\) is multiplicatively closed. \\(S^{-1}R\\) is a field because every nonzero fraction \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) has reciprocal \\(\\frac{b}{a}\\) (because \\(a \\in S\\)). Since \\(S\\) has no zerodivisors, the canonical map \\(f:R \\to S^{-1}R\\) is injective, so we may safely regard \\(R\\) to be a subring of this field. Thus every domain is a subring of its field of fractions.\n\n\n8.2.4 Universal Property\nTheorem: Let \\(R\\) be a commutative ring and \\(S\\) a multiplicatively closed set. Let \\(f:R \\to S^{-1}R\\) be the canonical map. Then for every \\(s \\in S\\), \\(f(s)\\) is a unit. Moreover for any map \\(g:R \\to T\\) with the property that for every \\(s \\in S\\), \\(g(s)\\) is a unit (in \\(T\\)), there is a unique map \\(G:S^{-1}R \\to T\\) so that \\(Gf = g\\)\nproof: The map is \\(G(\\frac{a}{b}) = g(a)g(b)^{-1}\\). Everything else (including well definedness) is left to the reader.\nShorthand: To define a map from \\(S^{-1}R\\), just define it on \\(R\\) and check \\(S\\) elements go to units."

    "text": "8.3 Ideal Correspondence for Localization\nWe’ve seen that the ideals of \\(R\\) and any quotient ring are closely related. In this section we’ll describe how the ideals of \\(R\\) relate to those of \\(S^{-1}R\\). The key concept is that the elements of \\(S\\) are transformed into units, so any ideal, no matter how small, that intersects \\(S\\) changes into the unit ideal.\nTheorem: Ideal Correspondence for Localization Let \\(f:R \\to S^{-1}R\\) be a canonical localization map. Then extension and contraction across \\(f\\) form a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence between the prime ideals of \\(S^{-1}R\\) and the prime ideals of \\(R\\) which are disjoint from \\(S\\).\nProof: 1. Order-preserving: Extension and contraction always preserve order.\n\n\\(J^{ce}= J\\): Let \\(J \\subseteq S^{-1}R\\) be a proper ideal. Then \\(J^c = \\{r \\in R \\,|\\, \\frac{r}{1} \\in J\\}\\) is known to be an ideal and must be disjoint from \\(S\\) because otherwise \\(J\\) would be a unit ideal. As always \\(J^{ce} \\subseteq J\\). For the reverse, if \\(\\frac{r}{s} \\in J\\) then \\(\\frac{r}{1}\\in J\\) by capture, so \\(r \\in J^c\\). It follows that \\(\\frac{r}{1} \\in J^{ce}\\) and finally \\(\\frac{r}{s} \\in J^{ce}\\) again by capture. Note this portion does not depend on primality of \\(J\\).\n\\(I^{ec}=I\\): Let \\(I \\subseteq R\\) be disjoint from \\(S\\). Notice that the set \\(\\{\\frac{i}{s} \\,|\\, i \\in I, s \\in S\\}\\) is an ideal and is a subset of any ideal containing \\(f(I)\\). It follows that \\(I^e = \\{\\frac{i}{s} \\,|\\, i \\in I, s \\in S\\}\\). If \\(r \\in I^{ec}\\) then \\(\\frac{r}{1} \\in I^e\\), so \\(\\frac{r}{1} = \\frac{i}{s}\\). This means \\(t(rs-i)=0\\) for some \\(t\\). Now if \\(I\\) is a prime ideal disjoint from \\(S\\), then since \\(t \\notin I\\), \\(rs-i \\in I\\), so \\(rs \\in I\\). Again by primality \\(s \\notin I\\) so \\(r \\in I\\). This proves \\(I^{ec} \\subseteq I\\). The other direction is guaranteed, so \\(I^{ec} = I\\).\nWe have established the correspondence. It remains to show it preserves primality. Contraction always preserves primality, so consider extension. If \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\frac{c}{d} \\in I^e = \\{\\frac{i}{s} \\,|\\, i \\in I, s \\in S\\}\\) then \\(ac \\in I\\). If \\(I\\) is prime then one of \\(a, c\\) is in \\(I\\), so one of the fractions is in \\(I^e\\). Thus \\(I^e\\) is prime."

Does it matter which of these operations comes first?\nTheorem: (Localization and Quotient Commute) Let \\(R\\) be a ring with multiplicatively closed set \\(S\\) and ideal \\(I\\) disjoint from \\(S\\). Let \\(S^{-1}I\\) denote the extension of \\(I\\) to \\(S^{-1}R\\) and let \\(S/I\\) denote \\(\\{s+I \\,|\\, s \\in S\\}\\).

All interactions with AI systems are consultations with an external source, just like a book or another person. Copying the work of an AI system and submitting it as ones own, even with some changes, is a form of plagiarism. Calling on AI for solutions to assigned problems is cheating, for the same reason that hiring your Mom to do your homework is cheating.\n\n\n4.2 Accommodative Services\nStudents who need accommodations to complete the requirements and expectations of this course because of a disability should contact the Office of Accommodative Services (136 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2590, oas@potsdam.edu) or complete their request by filling out the New Student Accommodation Request Form. Please note that accommodations are generally not provided retroactively so timely contact with the Office of Accommodative Services is important. Students registered with the Office of Accommodative Services (OAS) should use the Accommodate Portal to submit their “Semester Request” (Letter of Accommodation) every semester. This letter informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Further conversation with OAS, faculty, and the student may be warranted to ensure reasonable accommodations.\n\n\n4.3 Counseling Services\nAs a student at SUNY Potsdam, you may encounter various stressors that can affect your learning and academic performance. The College Counseling Center (CCC) offers a range of resources to support students in their mental health, social well-being, and overall academic experience. Students seeking to speak with a licensed mental health professional can access free services through the SUNY Potsdam Counseling Center. To connect with our services, please call 315-267-2330, email counseling@potsdam.edu, or visit us at Van Housen 131.\n\n\n4.4 Disruptive Student Policy\nIn order to maintain a fair, just, and safe College community environment, students are subject to SUNY Potsdam College regulations and are expected to abide by the Potsdam Pledge, the SUNY Potsdam Academic Catalog, and the Student Community Rights and Responsibilities (the Student Code of Conduct). Anyone who disrupts the academic learning environment (e.g., classrooms, labs, office hours, online platforms, emails, or other virtual communications) will be asked to leave for the day. Disruptions may include, but are not limited to, interrupting/speaking over other people, excessive use of foul or abusive or derogatory language, and repeated getting up/leaving/returning behavior. Students who exhibit aggressive/violent behavior in or out of classrooms will be asked to immediately leave. Disruptive students may be subject to disciplinary action, potentially including administrative removal from the course.\n\n\n4.5 Food Insecurity\nThe Prometheus Alumni Food Pantry is in 119 Barrington Student Union.

We are reminded by our presence here that we have the duty to live in harmony with one another and with all of creation. We are deeply grateful to the families and communities who care for this beautiful place. Beginning with colonization and continuing for centuries the Haudenosaunee Peoples have been dispossessed of most of their ancestral lands by the actions of individuals and institutions. We acknowledge our responsibility to understand and respond to those actions and to commit to working together to honor our past and build our future with truth. For more information on Land Acknowledgements, see Land_Acknowledgement at illuminative.org\n\n\n4.7 Success Statement\nSuccess in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in your courses or campus life as soon as it occurs and before it becomes too overwhelming. In addition, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you including the Counseling Center & the Case Manager, Student Health Services, Accommodative Services, and your academic advisor.\n\n\n4.8 Student Support\nEvery student in this class is a valued individual. If you are struggling with issues outside of the classroom, please know that there are professionals both on and off campus who can assist you.
