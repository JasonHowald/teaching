<section id="grading" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Assessments: We will have about seven unit tests (100 points each) and a final exam (200 points). We will have about eighteen homework assignments, averaging about 15 points each. Most homework uses the Webwork online homework system. Attendance is expected for all students, but not graded. Please inform your instructor if you have to miss class.</p>
<p>Grade weighting: About 700 points are determined by proctored in-class unit tests. About 250 points are determined by homework. About 200 are determined by a final exam. Final grades by percentage will be assigned as follows: 90-100: 4.0, 87-89: 3.7, 83-86: 3.3, 80-82: 3.0, 77-79: 2.7, 73-76: 2.3, 70-72: 2.0, 67-69: 1.7, 63-66: 1.3, 60-62: 1.0, 0-59: 0.0. No grades will be dropped.</p>
<p>Late Work Policy: Students have limited opportunities to submit late work, and need permission to do so.</p>
<p>Calendar of Topics and Assignments: See lecture slides (also shared) for details.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appendices">Appendices</h2>
<section id="ai-policy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ai-policy">AI Policy:</h3>
<p>Students are encouraged to leverage AI tools, such as Jupyter with code completion features or chatbots for learning help, to enhance their understanding of mathematical concepts and streamline computational tasks. All interactions with AI systems are consultations with an external source, just like a book or another person. Copying the work of an AI system and submitting it as ones own, even with some changes, is a form of plagiarism. Calling on AI for solutions to assigned problems is cheating, for the same reason that hiring your Mom to do your homework is cheating.</p>
</section>
<section id="thinking-mathematically" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="thinking-mathematically">Thinking Mathematically:</h3>
<p>Thinking Mathematically courses build proficiency with fundamental tools of mathematics, such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, functions, graphs, and statistics. They teach students precise quantitative logical reasoning and applications of mathematical problem-solving skills in abstract and real-world problems. They engage students in oral and written communication of mathematical ideas.</p>
<p>Math 125 fulfills the Thinking Mathematically requirement of the Pathways Core Curriculum.</p>
<section id="thinking-mathematically-student-learning-outcomes" class="level4">

<section id="methods-of-instruction-in-relation-to-slos" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methods-of-instruction-in-relation-to-slos">Methods of Instruction in relation to SLOs:</h4>
<p>SLO #1: Students use boxplots, histograms, scatterplots, and other visualizations to analyze data sets. Students use arithmetic and algebra to construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing. Students use functions and arithmetic to calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc) of datasets. Students use statistics throughout the course.</p>
<p>SLO #2: Students solve verbal problems distinguishing between correlation and causation on homework and exams. They verify conditions such as near-normality and sample size for hypothesis tests. They answer homework questions on experiment design which require that they attend to the experimental conditions necessary to draw various conclusions.</p>
<p>SLO #3: Students learn to use basic data analysis techniques to discover patterns in data. The central limit theorem provides a recurring pattern which students use to solve problems involving p-values, including hypothesis testing, on homework and exams.</p>
<p>SLO #4: Students use the empirical rule to produce confidence intervals for individual data points and later for parameters based on inference. To understand the general formulations of these rules, students must think of datasets generically and abstractly. On most homeworks, students use formulas for statistics, tests, and inferences which are expressed abstractly to perform concrete computations. The notions of statistic and parameter are themselves abstractions of data computations.</p>
<p>SLO #5: Students discuss Statistics problems and their solutions in collaborative group work. They present solutions to their peers in the classroom. They also submit individual written work in the form of homework, quizzes, and exams.</p>
<p>SLO’s #1-#5 will be assessed on various homework problems.</p>

<section id="accommodative-services" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accommodative-services">Accommodative Services</h3>
<p>Students who need accommodations to complete the requirements and expectations of this course because of a disability should contact the Office of Accommodative Services (136 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2590, oas@potsdam.edu) or complete their request by filling out the New Student Accommodation Request Form. Please note that accommodations are generally not provided retroactively so timely contact with the Office of Accommodative Services is important. Students registered with the Office of Accommodative Services (OAS) should use the Accommodate Portal to submit their “Semester Request” (Letter of Accommodation) every semester. This letter informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Further conversation with OAS, faculty, and the student may be warranted to ensure reasonable accommodations.</p>

<p>In order to maintain a fair, just, and safe College community environment, students are subject to SUNY Potsdam College regulations and are expected to abide by the Potsdam Pledge, the SUNY Potsdam Academic Catalog, and the Student Community Rights and Responsibilities (the Student Code of Conduct). Anyone who disrupts the academic learning environment (e.g., classrooms, labs, office hours, online platforms, emails, or other virtual communications) will be asked to leave for the day. Disruptions may include, but are not limited to, interrupting/speaking over other people, excessive use of foul or abusive or derogatory language, and repeated getting up/leaving/returning behavior. Students who exhibit aggressive/violent behavior in or out of classrooms will be asked to immediately leave. Disruptive students may be subject to disciplinary action, potentially including administrative removal from the course.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="land-acknowledgement">Land Acknowledgement</h3>
<p>We acknowledge with respect the Mohawk Nation, the Indigenous people on whose ancestral lands SUNY Potsdam now stands. We are reminded by our presence here that we have the duty to live in harmony with one another and with all of creation. We are deeply grateful to the families and communities who care for this beautiful place. Beginning with colonization and continuing for centuries the Haudenosaunee Peoples have been dispossessed of most of their ancestral lands by the actions of individuals and institutions. We acknowledge our responsibility to understand and respond to those actions and to commit to working together to honor our past and build our future with truth.

<section id="success-statement" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="success-statement">Success Statement</h3>
<p>Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in your courses or campus life as soon as it occurs and before it becomes too overwhelming. In addition, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you including the Counseling Center &amp; the Case Manager, Student Health Services, Accommodative Services, and your academic advisor.</p>
