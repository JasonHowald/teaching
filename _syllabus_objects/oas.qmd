### Accommodative Services 
Students who need accommodations to complete the requirements and expectations of this course because of a disability should contact the Office of Accommodative Services (136 Sisson Hall, (315) 267-2590, oas@potsdam.edu) or complete their request by filling out the New Student Accommodation Request Form. Please note that accommodations are generally not provided retroactively so timely contact with the Office of Accommodative Services is important. 
Students registered with the Office of Accommodative Services (OAS) should use the Accommodate Portal to submit their “Semester Request” (Letter of Accommodation) every semester. This letter informs faculty of potential course access and accommodations that might be necessary and reasonable. Further conversation with OAS, faculty, and the student may be warranted to ensure reasonable accommodations.
