## Preparatory Work
Read the [Wikipedia article on this topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation). Try to understand the comic on the next slide.

Man: I used to think correlation implied causation.
Man: Then I took a statistics class.  Now I don&#39;t.
Woman: Sounds like the class helped.
Man: Well, maybe."}

## Three explanations for correlation (at least!) {.activity}

:::: {.columns style="display: flex; gap: 50px;"}

:::{.column width="40%"}

For each scenario, which is more likely? Why?

* A influences B (directly or indirectly)

* B influences A (directly or indirectly)

* Some **lurking** variable is driving both A and B.

:::

:::{.column width="60%"}
1. Daily ice cream sales and gasoline sales are significantly correlated.
2. Social media use and depression are correlated.
3. In school children, finger length and reading ability are strongly correlated.
4. Both caffeinated soda use and ADHD diagnoses have increased in children over the last 20 years.
5. Young children who sleep with the light on are more likely to develop myopia (nearsightedness) in later life.

## Start with an open mind. {.activity}

Cultivate creative skepticism and critical thinking. 

Athletes with high PPG (points per game) have higher GPA (grade point average). 

Give three credible explanations based on the three forms of the previous slide.
Brainstorming all three explanation types!


## Lurking ("Confounding") variables

Any variable, often unmeasured, that drives a correlation between two other variables.
When discovered, lurking variables tend to explain away apparent relationships 
between other variables.

* Coffee consumption and lung cancer are positively correlated. (Really!) We should not 
conclude that coffee causes lung cancer. There may be lurking variables which we have not 
considered. One of the hallmarks of critical thinking is **not jumping to conclusions.**


## So... withhold judgment forever?

* Attendance rate is correlated to class grade.
* Laws against trans people are associated to violence against trans people.
* Within certain banks, loan acceptance is associated to applicant race.
* Cigarette smoking is correlated to lung cancer.

The idea of confounding variables can become a hater's new excuse to dismiss statistical evidence. In cases where common sense understanding, historical understanding, or controlled experimental support a conclusion, we can’t just wave it away!

## In an age of industrialized, weaponized, Grade-A propaganda, how do I know who or what to believe?

Yikes. I'm no oracle! These simple rules have served me well.

1. Study history. What's past is prologue.
2. The truth is often complicated. Get comfortable with nuance and be suspicious of those with none.
3. “When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.” –Maya Angelou
4. If the Nazis are on your side, you’re on the wrong side.
