## Preparation
Reread 2.1.5 on box plots and quantile statistics.
Review vocabulary:
Percentile, Quartile, Quintile
Median, Q1, Q3, IQR

## True or False {.activity}
Among American households, about half earn more than the average income and about half earn less.

On a very easy ten point assignment, about half of students will score above average, and about half will score below average

## Mean isn't typical

**Mean** does a poor job describing "typical," because it pulls hard toward outliers. 

**Median** does a better job describing "typical," because it mostly ignores outliers. 

## What is the median?

The median is the middle value by count. Roughly speaking, half the data 
values are less than the median and half are greater.

Finding the median: 

- Sort data numerically
- Find the center. 
- If count is odd, median is the middle one.
- If count is even, median is average of middel two.

Example data values: 5, 7, 8, 9, **9**, **9**, 10, 10, 11, 12

<small>Description: Ten data points are presented in sorted order, starting with 5 and ending with 12. The middle two are accented in bold and are both 9.</small>

The median is 9

## What is the median?

1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 9  ← Median is not zero. Sort first!

0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 9  ← Median is 2.

0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 96  ← Median is still 2. 

The median is insensitive to outliers and individual data errors. The mean is not. 
This is one reason the median is often preferred. 

## Using the median to understand your data. 

What is the median salary of MLB players? Use the mlb.csv dataset.

What is the median income of Americans? Use the acs12.csv dataset. 

What is the median birth weight of American babies? Use the births14.csv dataset.

In all these cases, mean may be deceptive because it's influenced by outliers. Median 
better reflects what is typical.

## Quartering the data

Make equal quarters by subdividing each half. Just like cutting an apple:
5, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12
Q1=8,   Median=9,   Q3=10, IQR = 2
Five-number summary: 5, 8, 9, 10, 12.  ← Foundation for the box plot if desired.
Odd/even fussiness applies to halves. 
Note: It’s not literally true that a quarter of the data lies between Q1 and Q2. But such statements are usually nearly true for large and continuous datasets. 

## Quartering the data – caution

Make equal quarters by subdividing each half. Just like cutting an apple:
5, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 10, 10, 11, 12
Q1=8,   Median=9,   Q3=10, IQR = 2
Caution: Jupyter (pandas) uses a slightly fancier policy for quartering the apple. This can cause confusion. Lecture, textbook, and homework are in sync, but pandas is different.
x = pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
print(x.quantile(.25), x.quantile(.5), x.quantile(.75))
2.75 4.5 6.25
x = pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])
print(x.quantile(.25), x.quantile(.5), x.quantile(.75))
3.0 5.0 7.0


## By hand? Ain’t nobody got time for that!

A data analyst needs to calculate Min, Q1, Median, Q3, and Max easily, quickly, and reliably, even for large datasets. How should this would be done? 
A certain online homework problem asks for Q1 and Q3 for a list of 27 numbers. There is no .csv file. How can we make Jupyter solve the problem?

## Median is more informative than Mean
This histogram displays the distribution of incomes in OpenIntro’s acs12 dataset. 
What can you say about a “typical” income in this population?

## Median is more informative than Mean
Most reports on “typical” American financial well being use quantile statistics – median household income, median net wealth, median rent, etc. Why?
In highly unequal societies, measures of wealth are strongly skewed right. For example, in acs12, the income variable has mean=23600, std=46600, median=3000, and skewness=4.6. (We won’t study skewness in detail, but that’s a lot!)
No single statistic describes the distribution fully, but the median often does a better job capturing what’s typical or normal.

## Individual work

Solve Webwork problems in assignment 11.

Here's a quantile statistic: The top 1% of Americans control about as much wealth as the bottom 90% [source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)]. See what you can do about that.
