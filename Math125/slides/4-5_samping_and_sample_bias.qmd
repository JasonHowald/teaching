## Preparation
Read section 1.3 – Sampling principles and strategies. Review vocabulary on next two slides.

## Key vocabulary – sampling

* **Population:** All conceivable cases.
* **Sample:** All cases measured and recorded.
* **Representative Sample:** Does a good job reflecting features of the population.
* **Biased Sample:** Skewed, slanted, not representative. Intentionally or accidentally.
* **Bias:** Anything causing a sample to be biased, from cruelty to oversight to unforeseeable effect.

## Key vocabulary – bias types

* **Participation bias or nonresponse bias:** You didn’t measure those who didn’t respond, and it might matter!
* **Pre-screening bias:** You must be this tall for the survey.
* **Survivorship bias:** Only “survivors” are included.
* **Undercoverage bias:** Significant subpopulations were missed.
* **Geographic bias:** Selecting from a town, street corner, etc.


## A pollster’s dilemma {.activity}
Which of these should a political polling organization accomplish in order 
to responsibly estimate the outcome of an upcoming election?

1. Interview lots and lots of people.
2. Include a diversity of people (in age, race, hometown, education, etc) roughly in accord with the population.
3. Predict who probably will not vote in the election.
4. Prompt the “undecided” to predict their decision.
5. Draw no inference when people refuse to participate.

(Good political polling is very, very hard!)

## Food costs money {.activity}

We want to estimate the average household grocery bill in St. Lawrence county.
What is the population of interest?

You plan to sample 100 households. What are some natural sources of sampling bias and how could you mitigate them?

## Hours reading – a sampling puzzle {.activity}
You want to measure how much time an average university student spends reading. 
What is the population of interest (in your opinion)?
What are some natural sources of sampling bias and how could you mitigate them?

## Focus on survivorship bias {.activity}
Explain how each observation or inference is vulnerable to survivorship bias.

1. “When I was a kid we took more risks. I turned out fine!”
2. Early human artistic expression was primarily cave paintings.
3. University professors learn about modern high school from their students.
4. We analyzed the 500 largest US companies to see whether US energy policy benefits or hinders them.
5. Architecture in ancient Greece was mostly just colossal stonework.

## Survivorship bias for the win {.activity}
Abraham Wald famously studied aircraft damage during WWII. He examined 
post-mission bullet holes on bombers. (Image is compilation across many planes.)

Dots cluster on the wingtips, tail, and fuselage but are absent at the engines, cockpit, and nose."}

Question: The bomber can carry a small bit of extra weight for shielding. Where should extra shielding be placed to protect aircraft?

## Who, me, biased? {.activity}

Explain how almost every type of sampling bias applies to this fictional scenario:

> "Here at Dominant Dynamics Corp., we pride ourselves on inclusivity, especially in June! We set up a survey table in our corporate lobby where we interviewed employees: “Attention LGBTQIA+ employees! Is this a safe and supportive environment for you?”


## Key vocabulary – Sampling strategies
* **Simple (SRS):** Select from one flat list.
* **Stratified:** Identify strata of interest, sample some of each stratum.
* **Cluster:** Divide into convenient clusters. Randomly select some clusters. Take all of each selected cluster.
* **Multistage:** Like cluster, but take some of each selected cluster.

## Identifying the sampling strategy {.activity}
You want to survey college students about relationship viewpoints.
Ana: We’ll each pick a residence hall and knock ten random doors within it.
Biljana: Let’s ask the registrar for a list of 100 random current students. Then we can email them!
Marija: Let’s coordinate with five random professors, and survey everybody in their classes.
Dragan: It may depend on relationship status. We need to get a sample with the right number of people who are single, dating, married, etc. 
Bonus: To generate their names I picked a nation at random, <!-- It was Serbia. --> then chose four random names common within that nation. What sampling strategy did I use?

## Value judgments {.activity}
Which is most correct? 

1. Simple random is the best method and should always be used.
2. Simple random is the best method but is often impractical. 
3. Stratified sampling is the best method but is sometimes impossible.
4. Cluster sampling reduces the bias of simple random sampling.
5. Multistage sampling helps to increase the sample size.

## Value judgments – competing priorities {.activity}
<!-- Igbo names, probably Nigeria -->

Uche asserts: “Large sample sizes are better for my purposes.” <!-- OO-chay -->

Abike asserts: “Small sample sizes are better for my purposes.” <!-- ah-BEE-keh -->

Why might both speakers be correct?
