# Introductory Logic

## Not neither
Write a truth table for "(not $P$) and (not $Q$)". This could be called a "neither nor" truth table. Using that, infer a truth table for "NOT ((not $P$) and (not $Q$))". This could be called, awkwardly, a truth table for "not neither nor". It should exactly match a more familiar table. Which one?

## Syntax or Semantics
For each logical critique, identify whether it is primarily a *syntax* issue or a *semantic* issue.

1. Your parentheses don't match.
2. Your premise is *usually* true but not *always* true.
3. Your first premise uses the word "political" with one meaning, but your second premise uses the word "political" with a slightly different meaning.
4. The form of the argument is "if $P$ then $Q$. Moreover $Q$. Therefore $P$." This is not a valid argument structure.
5. Your handwriting is messy.
6. Your conclusion is a generalization, but I know a specific exception. So something in your argument has to be wrong.

## Double negative
If $P$ is an assertion, does $\neg \neg P$ have the same meaning as $P$? Explain.


## Algebra as proof
Consider this algebraic proof:

$$
\begin{align}
x^2 = 3x-2\\
x^2 -3x + 2 = 0\\
(x-2)(x-1) = 0\\
x-2 = 0  \,\,\underline{\hspace{1in}}\,\, x-1 = 0\\
x = 2  \,\,\underline{\hspace{1in}}\,\, x = 1\\
\end{align}
$$

  - The blank spaces represent the word "or" or "and". Which is most appropriate, and why?
  - If this is a direct proof of something, what does it establish?
    - If $x^2 = 3x-2$ then $x$ is 2 and/or 1.    
    - The numbers $1$ and $2$ are solutions to the equation $x^2 = 3x-2$
    - $x$ is equal to both $1$ and $2$.
    - Algebra is awesome.
  - Is the larger argument correct for *all* $x$, for *some certain* $x$, or for *only* $x=1$ or $x=2$?

## The smallest number

Consider the following proof:

> Let $\varepsilon$ be the smallest positive real number. Then $0 < \varepsilon$. Dividing both sides of this equation by $2$, we have
$0 < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}$. Adding $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ to both sides, we have $\frac{\varepsilon}{2} < \varepsilon$. We have shown that $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$ is positive and smaller than $\varepsilon$, but this is directly at odds with the nature (first sentence) of $\varepsilon$.

- What is an appropriate conclusion of the proof?
  - $\frac{\varepsilon}{2} < \varepsilon$
  - There must be an algebraic mistake.
  - There is no smallest positive real number.
  - There may be a smallest positive real number, but it isn't $\varepsilon$
  - $\varepsilon$ is the smallest positive real number but there is a smaller positive real number, namely $\frac{\varepsilon}{2}$

- What proof structure is used above? (i.e., direct, contrapositive, contradiction, etc)?

## Flat Earth
Consider the following joke argument:

> If the Earth were flat, then in the past thousands of years, cats would have knocked everything off the edge by now. They haven't done so, so the Earth isn't flat.

- Is this an argument by contradiction, by contrapositive, or by modus tollens? Explain.

## $\cup$ and $\cap$ distribution
Prove that $A \cap (B \cup C) \subseteq
(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$. The goal is to reason explicitly from the arbitrary particular to the general. Remember that any subset statement is a generalization about all elements of one set.

## Getting even
Prove that for all integers $n$, $n^2+n$ is even.

# Set Theory

## I order a sub with nothing on it.
Here $A$ is an arbitary set and $\emptyset$ is the empty set.

1. Is the statement "$\forall x (x \in \emptyset \to x \in A)$" true or false? Explain.
2. Rewrite the statement (without changing its meaning) so that it uses the subset "$\subseteq$" symbol.

## Reading set notation
What are the elements of this set?

$$\left \{ x \in {\mathbb N} \Bigm| (x \text{ is odd}) \to (x \text{ is prime}) \right\} $$

## Writing set notation
Write in set builder notation a set which contains just the odd perfect squares.

## Explain a set
What set is this describing, and why?
$$\left \{ a \in \{1,2,3\} \Bigm| a \notin {\mathbb N} \right\} $$


## Interval notation
Rewrite this set using [interval notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Notations_for_intervals):
$$ \left \{ q^2 \Bigm| q \in {\mathbb R}, -3\leq q \leq 3  \right\} $$

## Integers and <

$ \left \{ x \in {\mathbb N}  \Bigm|  \exists y \in {\mathbb N}\,\, y < x \right\} $

# Functions

## Possible images
A function $f$ has domain $\{1,2,3\}$ and range ${\mathbb R}$. What are the possibilities for the image of $f$?


## No entity without identity
Let $f:{\mathbb R} \to {\mathbb R}$ by $f(x) = x^2+1$ and let $g:{\mathbb R} \to {\mathbb R}$ by $g(t) = t^2+1$.

1. True or False: $f(x)=g(x)$
2. True or False: $f(x)=g(t)$
3. True or False: $f=g$
4. True or False: $f$ and $g$ are the same function.

## You keep using that word. 
Let $f: {\mathbb R} \to {\mathbb R}$ by $f(x) = 3x+5$.

1. Tell the additive inverse of $f$
2. Tell the multiplicative inverse of $f$.
3. Tell the functional inverse of $f$.

## Domain, range, and arcsin
For the function $\sin(x)$

1. Tell the normal domain and range of the function $\sin(x)$.
2. Tell the domain and range of the function $\arcsin(x)$.
3. In order for the functions to be inverse functions, how exactly must the domains and ranges of each function be adjusted?

## Domain, range, arctan
For the function $\tan(x)$

1. Tell the normal domain and range of the function $\tan(x)$.
2. Tell the domain and range of the function $\arctan(x)$.
3. In order for the functions to be inverse functions, how exactly must the domains and ranges of each function be adjusted?

## Sum and inverse
Let $f: {\mathbb R}^3 \to {\mathbb R}$ by $f([x,y,z]) = x+y+z$.

1. Find a function $g$ which is a right inverse of $f$.  
2. Prove that $g$ is a right inverse of $f$.
3. Prove that $f$ is surjective, using the previous part.

## Surjective, inverse optional.
Let $h:{\mathbb R} \to {\mathbb R}$ by $h(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 3x - 1$. Prove that $h$ is surjective. (Hint: Although there might be another way, I expect that factoring the polynomial will be enormously useful!)

## Injective $\to$ left invertible
Let $f:A \to B$ be a function, and assume both $A$ and $B$ are nonempty. We've proven that if $f$ has a left inverse, then it is injective. Prove, conversely, that if $f$ is injective, it has a left inverse.

## There is no surjectivity.
Some say that if a function is truly nothing more than a set of ordered (input/output) pairs, then surjectivity is meaningless. Explain.

## Induction? Hard to say.
Explain in your own words why the principle of mathematical induction is problematic within a simple number theory in which the only mathematical objects of relevance are natural numbers.

## Powers of 2 equivalence
Let $x$ and $y$ be natural numbers, we write $x \sim y$ to mean $y/x$ is a power of $2$. (Powers of $2$ are numbers $2^n$ for all $n \in {\mathbb Z}$, including $1$, $1/2$, etc.) Prove that $x \sim y$ is an equivalence relation.

## Ordering tasks.
A complex to-do list contains many tasks. We use variables $x$ and $y$ to range over the tasks themselves. For example, $x=$(repair faucet) and $y=$(rake leaves). Some tasks have interdependencies. We write $x \le y$ to mean $x=y$ or $x$ must be completed before $y$ can begin. For example (buy brake light replacement) $\le$ (install brake light replacement). Discuss each of the five order axioms in this context. Which are true? Is this system a partial order? total order? well order?
